Speaker 1 (00:00:11,273-00:00:13,492): George, congratulations.
Speaker 0 (00:00:14,959-00:00:15,399): Thank you.
Speaker 1 (00:00:15,399-00:00:16,579): What does it feel like?
Speaker 0 (00:00:16,878-00:00:21,456): Yeah. Look, it's been pretty crazy enough, obviously, on top of the water right now. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:00:21,916-00:00:24,455): Does it feel like you're living in a fog like a dream?
Speaker 0 (00:00:25,534-00:00:39,656): A little bit, but I've had that vision, you know, for so long. You know, I've manifested for so long and, you know, before this fight, Even as a young amateur, a new award champion, a new one that more time would come in, you know, it finally did.
Speaker 1 (00:00:39,716-00:00:57,886): Well, I was told about you a couple of years ago, by my friend Vinny Sharma, who's big in the MoiTai world, and Liam Harrison is a MoiTai world champion. They were telling me how awesome you were years ago. But until Saturday night of last week, the world, you know, they didn't know. They had to see it.
Speaker 0 (00:00:58,314-00:01:09,118): Look. Bye for Greg, guys. And I think it was 2018. I was in this in a wildcard gym sparring. And I'm in the ring and I see these 2 guys and they're watching.
Speaker 0 (00:01:09,118-00:01:25,178): So, you know, I'll put on a show for these guys. And let's say they might be someone that can say it was the next level that might be promoters who knows. So we always wanna put put on a show, and they couldn't believe it. And then I knew that they'll come in on your show when I started speaking to them. And when they dropped my name money, I was like, wow.
Speaker 0 (00:01:25,178-00:01:28,617): This amazing. Now I'm here with you. No, sir.
Speaker 1 (00:01:28,617-00:01:39,480): Well, your performance against your female was spectacular. It was amazing. And, I mean, it was a a fight where how much of an underdog were you coming into that fight?
Speaker 0 (00:01:39,519-00:01:56,150): I was a huge underdog, you know, 7 to 1 on the dog. Wow. You know, better on one dot AJ had me 7 to 1. So, you know, that just shows the the adversity that you have to come through. You can be a massive underdog, but no matter what, you know, you get food and you you can win whatever you choose to do.
Speaker 1 (00:01:56,269-00:02:15,969): Well, you were undefeated coming into that fight, but you just hadn't faced the same level of opposition that he had. And it didn't mean that you weren't capable of it. It just you just hadn't had the opportunity before. So it wasn't a 7 to 1, like, they didn't think you had the skills. It was 7 to 1 that you just hadn't had that that moment in the sun before.
Speaker 0 (00:02:16,228-00:02:48,650): I think because that's right. I haven't had my moment yet letting it to that fight, but you know, he was coming off the big on the Changuo fight, the big win there, what he'd done in that fight so impressive. He knocked out Richard communist world, so the hype, the the the noise that he was making, this was just gonna be a normal mandatory fight. You know, that took so long to make, and he was supposed to do the business. And move on to something bigger, but that hunger that I had, you know, that that tunnel vision to show who I am, to show how great I am, and I had to go through it all in that fight.
Speaker 0 (00:02:49,009-00:02:57,694): From the cuts to being put down around 10, but I knew that. This is my greatness now, how how good I can be and show the world. And Shocked the world.
Speaker 1 (00:02:57,914-00:03:18,522): It is you definitely did shock the world. It is a reoccurring theme in boxing and in all combat sports. When someone takes an opponent lightly. And they go in thinking they're just gonna steamroll this guy and then they get met with reality. I mean, it's happened so many times in fighter's careers.
Speaker 1 (00:03:19,062-00:03:31,714): And then there's also the other reoccurring theme, a guy like yourself. Who has his eyes on the prize is completely focused and people are counting them out, then they rise the occasion to become a superstar. And that hasn't happened to you.
Speaker 0 (00:03:31,714-00:03:54,441): You you said it many times. And and I feel that he didn't take me lightly because he's in great shape. He was in unbelievable condition. I felt as we led into the fight and we had that first press conference where we're looking to each other's eyes. And I saw that the, you know, a guy who, it came too fast, and he needed to be matched with someone that was not gonna take a step backwards.
Speaker 0 (00:03:54,709-00:04:03,565): And the whole thing was his whole preparation. I was never gonna take one step backwards. I never gave him that that inch. And even in the fight, I never gave him that inch. I was always there to be dominant.
Speaker 0 (00:04:03,794-00:04:15,398): And I felt like he was a it was a bully kind of character, you know, where he bullied Lomi Shankar. He bullied Kami. Yeah. He bullied all his his past opponents. But, you know, I've come from bullying.
Speaker 0 (00:04:15,398-00:04:18,357): I was an overweight kid at a young age. I've been bullied all my life.
Speaker 1 (00:04:18,357-00:04:19,076): You were overweight.
Speaker 0 (00:04:19,076-00:04:28,790): I was overweight. I used to be a £135 at, like, 10 years of age until I fell into boxing. So, you know, I knew it straight away. Okay. I knew how to stand up to this guy.
Speaker 0 (00:04:28,830-00:04:37,224): Know what I gotta do in this fight, and he saw how serious I was. So, you know, we we we stayed focused. We kept the tunnel vision. We we done the business.
Speaker 1 (00:04:37,324-00:04:56,633): Well, you did a beautiful job of boxing him as well. I mean, you stayed in the pocket and cut angles. You landed beautiful combinations. That one right hand in the first round though really set the tone for that fight. When you sat him down at the end of the first and dropped him, and it was just and and it was a hard right hand.
Speaker 1 (00:04:56,633-00:05:07,907): I mean, there was a beautiful right hand. And when you see his eyes roll back and he drops and he gets up and he's like, what, though? Fuck just happened. That was a giant wake up call, and it really set the tone for the rest of the fight.
Speaker 0 (00:05:07,927-00:05:17,381): It did. I'll wait until that that first round. I knew he'd be very emotional. I knew he took it so personal and leading up to the whole fortnight when I kept getting asked. Is this personal for you?
Speaker 0 (00:05:17,381-00:05:27,915): Because I knew I knew it was so personal for him. So, no, this is business for me. This is this is another fight. This is what I love to do. Doesn't matter who's in in that sort of the ring for fighting against me.
Speaker 0 (00:05:28,114-00:05:40,938): And I knew I had to get his respects right away. He would come out crazy. I stayed composed. I learned some really good short shots on the on the inside in the first round. And like the great customer, I said to Muhammad Ali, 24 George Foreman.
Speaker 0 (00:05:41,397-00:05:53,971): He goes, am I gonna beat this guy? How can I beat this punch out? And because guys, hitting with the right hand. In the first round, hit him with your best right hand and show him that, hey, I can punch as well. And I had that in my head.
Speaker 0 (00:05:54,190-00:06:02,296): You know, I I have the great book by custom item. I haven't highlighted it. And before I went to the arena, I went over it, I showed it to my to just have it in my head.
Speaker 1 (00:06:02,436-00:06:15,698): What a amazing mindy head? Custom model's mind for boxing, for the psychology of boxing, which is so incredible. You know? And to fact that Mike Tyson found that man when he was thirteen years old. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:06:15,698-00:06:17,777): It's almost like destiny. You know?
Speaker 0 (00:06:17,777-00:06:34,118): And you know what? I believe that everything in law is destiny. You know, I look at my road to to get to the championship. It just it just fall into place, but with Destiny, you need to work hard. You need to you know, take it in your own hands as well, but everything's meant to be.
Speaker 0 (00:06:34,118-00:06:45,412): And that right hand was meant to be, and I said it to my team. Like, are you watching the first show? I'm gonna catch him early. I'm gonna hurt him with something because knew I was looking for that right hand. And when he came out crazy, and he and he was heavy on the front foot.
Speaker 0 (00:06:45,412-00:06:54,087): He tried to fake the jab, and I saw that front foot right there. I knew he's head wouldn't move. Here it is. Here's that shot. I've been dreaming about my whole life.
Speaker 0 (00:06:54,466-00:06:56,575): Fang. I let it go like a lightning strike
Speaker 1 (00:06:56,615-00:07:02,771): Let's take a look at it. Jamie show me that punch because that was just so beautiful. I screamed when I was at home and I watched it.
Speaker 0 (00:07:02,771-00:07:03,331): Yeah. They
Speaker 1 (00:07:03,331-00:07:06,079): yelled out. I was by myself. I sit in the living room.
Speaker 0 (00:07:07,218-00:07:18,272): The whole world just jumped on the boat. Okay. Now we gotta fly because I don't think many expected me to even stand a chance in the first round. You know, that was so vocal about one round, one round, especially dad.
Speaker 1 (00:07:18,571-00:07:23,628): Well, his dad made a huge bet he bet a $100,000 that he was gonna knock you out within two rounds.
Speaker 0 (00:07:23,628-00:07:26,467): Yeah. Well, I wanna find out the person he bet against because
Speaker 1 (00:07:26,467-00:07:28,925): here it is. Take a look at this and take it in.
Speaker 0 (00:07:28,964-00:07:30,824): Okay. That's Nice. Beautiful answer.
Speaker 1 (00:07:30,884-00:07:42,577): Well, it's you were in front of them, but you weren't there. That was what was beautiful about it. Like, your head movement, like, right there that angle, God's just gorgeous box. Here it is. Right here, baby.
Speaker 1 (00:07:43,037-00:07:44,896): Bank. Oh my goodness.
Speaker 0 (00:07:46,235-00:07:51,192): And I saw it in his eyes. As soon as I land that shot, he got up. He said, what the fuck was that?
Speaker 1 (00:07:51,192-00:07:53,360): I can see it right there. He's like, woah. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:07:53,439-00:07:54,319): Now we're in the floor. And
Speaker 1 (00:07:54,319-00:07:55,358): then the the fake smile.
Speaker 0 (00:07:55,358-00:08:02,745): I'm not sure. Then here. Bye. Wow. I was a little bit off balance, but that shot there was was probably more devastating than the the original shot.
Speaker 0 (00:08:03,024-00:08:07,862): And then I'm just going off. I had to say it. I said, you know, now I'm here. One round.
Speaker 1 (00:08:07,862-00:08:08,662): Is that what you said?
Speaker 0 (00:08:08,662-00:08:12,229): Just I said one round. Okay. Oh my god. Now we're in a fight.
Speaker 1 (00:08:12,488-00:08:17,435): It was an amazing performance. Why why was it emotional for him? What was what was about
Speaker 0 (00:08:18,034-00:08:32,596): He had this this theory in his head and the paper around him. You know, someone told him that when he tested positive for COVID, I'm in Miami. I was very upset, very disappointed, and I transformed for 4 months preparation.
Speaker 1 (00:08:32,656-00:08:35,324): There's there's a fight was rescheduled, like, five times
Speaker 0 (00:08:35,364-00:08:55,324): Yeah. Or June 19th was the original date. And 4 days, the 80 test positive for COVID. So on the day that I found out, obviously, I've been away from my kids, my family, I flew my pregnant wife, and they had to be with me, you know, for that flight week, she took a lot of sacrifice as well because the doctors were telling her not to go. To the way the world is at the moment, but Right.
Speaker 0 (00:08:55,383-00:09:18,622): You know, it's the sacrifice we make. And, you know, when I found that was devastated, that you want to cry because it's how much it meant to me. And then I was obviously angry and upset. So that night, when we were going back to our room, we had a dinner and went to the the room, on the way to the room, There was the bar, and his team were having a good time and enjoying themselves. Obviously, not Lopez was not there.
Speaker 0 (00:09:19,201-00:09:35,092): And I found a stranger go out there and join themselves. Had their son just, you know, ruin the fight. But one of his team members try to be a smart ass and come up and try to take a fight out and try to be you know, try to aggravate me. And I've got my wife. They've got my my my father with me.
Speaker 0 (00:09:35,092-00:09:40,549): I've got my team. I said, look. Just stay away. It's not the time. You know, I don't know you guys might have COVID.
Speaker 0 (00:09:40,768-00:09:50,823): You know, you're with you with lapers all the time. And they got a little bit more aggressive and try to push the matter. And I said, look, just get the fuck out of you. I don't wanna deal with it right now. That's all it was.
Speaker 0 (00:09:50,823-00:10:05,975): And all of a sudden, someone's gone and told him that I've had a goldie's mother, which I never even saw his mother. I don't even know what she looks like. And that just played. I think they're trying to motivate motivate him. I think they're just trying to push him a little bit extra, make it more personal, but it's the worst thing.
Speaker 0 (00:10:05,975-00:10:16,899): You don't wanna take this any combat sport personal. As soon as you do, everything's slow. You you you lose your reactions. You're going to head hunting and you can see it. He was head hunting and you know, perfect.
Speaker 0 (00:10:16,899-00:10:20,018): I felt I felt perfect for for me that I what what I was coming to do?
Speaker 1 (00:10:20,018-00:10:31,751): Well, you maintained that composure through the entire twelve round fight 2, which was incredible. Like your your precision, your movement. You never got you never got lazy. You never just stood in front of them. You know?
Speaker 1 (00:10:31,751-00:10:42,136): And even when you got caught in the 10th, you still bounced back beautifully in 11th. I mean, you were you were you never you didn't adjust. You didn't change anything. You know, you didn't, like, become hesitant.
Speaker 0 (00:10:42,235-00:11:09,210): Yep. And that's a testament to my conditioning and how hard I train and how prepared I am for every single flight. And that's been my whole career, you know, from my pro debuted to Within the undisputed championship, I've prepared for every opponent, given them respect and prepared as a world championship fought. So when I got put down around 10, I was actually smiling. I was enjoying the the whole adversity because this is what makes fights like this great.
Speaker 0 (00:11:09,609-00:11:24,080): And you're okay. Now you're gonna show how great you are. You're gonna rise, and I was a minute 45 in that round. I think Lopez finishes any other layaway in the world at that stage, but not this layaway. And I had that that that inside me.
Speaker 0 (00:11:24,559-00:11:35,114): And, you know, it's it's crazy. How bad were you hurt? By that right here. I wasn't badly hurt. It was more like a a flash knockdown, you know, kind of back at the year, cut the year.
Speaker 0 (00:11:35,114-00:11:46,378): Mhmm. The equilibrium was a little bit out, but it's gonna take a lot more than than that shot to to put me away. I come back to the to the corner and the coaches were like, you're right. Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 0 (00:11:46,378-00:11:50,076): Okay. I'm good. I started smiling. Okay. You're sure why he's smiling for.
Speaker 0 (00:11:50,376-00:12:00,899): So because I made the mistake there. Now, watch what I'm gonna do. Watch how great I'm gonna be. I think round 11 was the best round of the fight, literally, busted him up. And then ran 12 classes shy.
Speaker 1 (00:12:00,999-00:12:03,537): That cut that he had over his left eye was brutal.
Speaker 0 (00:12:03,557-00:12:13,880): It was. It was it was from a punch of the devil shot, spit him open. Marlin was from a a head clash. So, you know, they they thought I couldn't punch. They thought I didn't have the the power.
Speaker 1 (00:12:13,959-00:12:18,098): Why do you think they thought that? Is that just wishful thinking? Did they just get overconfident?
Speaker 0 (00:12:18,997-00:12:45,191): I think because my last few thoughts when I fought Mickey Bayley, so it'll be both former world champions. You know, I I didn't lock them out, but these guys are veterans of the sport guys that have been there before. So they know how to to move around the ring. Much more experience than what all was at that stage and greater more experience than what Lopez has. I just had the box nice with him guys, you know, learn the tricks from the veterans, but they felt the power as well.
Speaker 0 (00:12:45,191-00:12:52,078): So I knew what I possess. I knew what I had it in in in the tank and and in the bank. And that's it. I'm a business against lipist.
Speaker 1 (00:12:52,937-00:13:08,208): Having been trained with Manny Pacquiao had to be a huge asset for asset for you because even though Bay was probably your biggest name opponent up until then Yeah. You know, you'd been how many rounds did you done with Manny?
Speaker 0 (00:13:08,208-00:13:11,867): 250 rounds. I have a 3 wheel total campaigns. So
Speaker 1 (00:13:12,046-00:13:13,965): so it started with the Jeff Horn fight.
Speaker 0 (00:13:14,124-00:13:36,972): It did here when when Jeff got, obviously, the fall with many packers. I was in Los Angeles, and I was sparring he's sparring expiring partners. Highs ever mirrors and Ribo Tran. I was doing 4 by 4, and this guy was a good 4 others, 4 ball champions. And Freddie come over and goes goes, you know, Manny's got the Jeff 1 for it.
Speaker 0 (00:13:36,972-00:13:51,362): So, yeah, I'm hearing about it. Because will your spark his spark partners, how would you lock to go against your your countrymen and help many prepare? Said, Freddie, I'm all in. You know, I know he's my country man, but it's an opportunity for a lifetime. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:13:51,362-00:13:52,241): That is my idol.
Speaker 1 (00:13:52,241-00:13:53,241): You can't pass that on.
Speaker 0 (00:13:53,241-00:14:13,439): So I had a fight if a couple weeks after the spiral sessions that that I impressed and got the opportunity. So I still had to win that fight against that Kamal Barla in New Zealand. And in between that fight, I got a really bad cut on my eye. And the first thing that that went to my head was, I got to spy with Manny Pacquiao in a week and a half. Okay.
Speaker 0 (00:14:13,439-00:14:27,630): Now this come might might stop it. So I wasn't even thinking about the opponent or thinking about the fight. I knew I was gonna win this fight by any means. But I was thinking about more opportunity as many pack here, but, you know, we got the stitches. We got the stitches.
Speaker 0 (00:14:27,709-00:14:42,282): Yeah. A week after, it just came out. I was putting so much vitamin a cream and every bit of, you know, theory that I could find on the Internet to to make sure clothes are not good. And wasn't gonna give me an issue, and I went into that first fire session with Manny, and it was like, okay, with a with a cut.
Speaker 1 (00:14:42,282-00:14:43,961): Did you know Jeff, Lauren?
Speaker 0 (00:14:43,961-00:14:46,479): I did know Jeff. Yeah. Yeah. We were in the amateur together.
Speaker 1 (00:14:46,479-00:14:48,518): How did he feel about you training with Matt? Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:14:48,518-00:15:00,891): He wasn't happy at that stage. You know? But he's a good guy. He's actually a good guy at the sport, and at that stage, he had come out and and said, you know, why is he going against me? He's country, and why couldn't he give me a phone call?
Speaker 0 (00:15:01,199-00:15:12,923): And me being me, you know, I I turned around. He met a school teacher and said, I've never asked for permission, you know, from from a school teacher ever. So I'm gonna I'm gonna go do my thing with with Packet no matter what.
Speaker 1 (00:15:12,923-00:15:15,222): I think he's gotta understand that you had too.
Speaker 0 (00:15:15,282-00:15:17,321): And I think he does. I think he does now.
Speaker 1 (00:15:17,321-00:15:28,353): Yeah. He had too. And to be able to have an opportunity like that to spar 250 rounds with 1 of the grays of all time. I mean, what did he want world titles and what 8 divisions?
Speaker 0 (00:15:28,353-00:15:32,311): 8 divisions. 13 or 14 world titles. Crazy. It will never be done again.
Speaker 1 (00:15:32,311-00:15:32,751): Crazy.
Speaker 0 (00:15:32,751-00:15:40,846): And as much as you wanna see records broken and, you know, I wanna I wanna break records. That man is a one of 1.
Speaker 1 (00:15:40,846-00:15:51,651): He's a one of 1. I mean, when he knocked down Thurman, in that that fight. I was like, this is crazy. Yeah. This guy's forty years old and still can crack and still as fast as lightning.
Speaker 0 (00:15:51,750-00:16:00,716): Yeah. Look. The power that he possesses, but it's not a bumping power. It's that explosive speed Mhmm. That explosive power, the forward he gets in position.
Speaker 0 (00:16:01,065-00:16:16,756): Another son, he's landed 3, 4, 5 shots, and then he's angled off. A lot like I did in my fighting in sloping, you know, a lot of that, you know, expiring paid off, and it did shape me. And I know he did put out a tweet as well saying that I hope the spying we did, you know, helped you win this fight and straight away.
Speaker 1 (00:16:16,756-00:16:17,476): That's a and I
Speaker 0 (00:16:17,476-00:16:19,764): was also excited. He's a legend of the sport.
Speaker 1 (00:16:19,764-00:16:24,662): He is a legend, and he's a he's such an unusual guy. You know what's crazy about him is his calves.
Speaker 0 (00:16:24,881-00:16:25,121): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:16:25,121-00:16:28,908): When you look at They're they're giant. They're like a thigh.
Speaker 0 (00:16:28,908-00:16:45,199): And I know the reason why why because in general Santos, the mountains that he runs and that's steep hill. That's why they're so big because he's always constantly running mountains. And I was doing the mountains with him. Yeah. My cough started getting bigger and bigger.
Speaker 0 (00:16:45,618-00:16:58,161): But I understand why his coughs are huge, but he's always bouncing. He's always moving around. He'll bounce for, like, 20 something rounds. You know, he'll do his pads, and he's jumping up and down. And, you know, he really is an unbelievable person.
Speaker 0 (00:16:58,161-00:17:06,556): Umbrella was laid and and a legend of the sport. I think as time progresses, people are really gonna, you know, appreciate his greatness.
Speaker 1 (00:17:06,976-00:17:18,798): Yeah. And and coming back from defeats too. I mean, he's a guy that's had his downs. He's had his ups and his downs. And, you know, he always many people always smiling and always friendly to people.
Speaker 1 (00:17:18,798-00:17:21,817): It's like he's so admirable just as a human being.
Speaker 0 (00:17:21,877-00:17:28,462): And it shows too that defeat. You know? I love how the UFC is. You know? A losses.
Speaker 0 (00:17:28,642-00:17:44,312): A losses. Yeah. And that boxing has this the stereotype where the 0 is is so important. I'm on the footer, but would you rather rather say the best one and the best? You know, I'm gonna get competitive fights and great fights, but unfortunately, boxing is not like that.
Speaker 1 (00:17:44,312-00:17:48,010): Well, the biggest draw on the sport is Canelo, and Canelo is not undefeated.
Speaker 0 (00:17:48,110-00:17:48,590): That's right.
Speaker 1 (00:17:48,590-00:17:55,915): It's way looking at it. You know, he lost a Floyd. Yeah. When you know, Manny is also like a world class pool player.
Speaker 0 (00:17:56,394-00:18:01,552): Well, he's got the pool tables. Yeah. That he's mentioning. He's he's really good. He's yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:18:01,552-00:18:01,992): No. It's like
Speaker 1 (00:18:01,992-00:18:02,971): he plays, like, a professional.
Speaker 0 (00:18:02,971-00:18:07,678): And he's and he loves his basketball. Yeah. She seemed quite worried about it. Shooting freeze. It's it's unbelievable.
Speaker 1 (00:18:07,898-00:18:17,832): Wow. It's a serious athlete. Yeah. Did did training with him did you make any changes to the way you approach fights or the way you prepare for fights after training with them?
Speaker 0 (00:18:17,832-00:18:32,173): I did. I learned the 1% is the the extra bit to do the extra rounds. You know, usually before the sparring with many Pacquiao, you know, you do your your eight rounds, your ten rounds of pads. And you're aspiring. But that's it.
Speaker 0 (00:18:32,173-00:18:41,739): You do your book and you finish with him. He does his pad work. He does his spine, but then he's on the bag. He's on the the shadow box. Thing he said doing the the pad work.
Speaker 0 (00:18:41,838-00:18:52,783): So that extra rounds just builds that that conditioning and that stamina. And that's what I just found that push more rounds. You know? If your body can keep going, push more and more. That's what I learned from him.
Speaker 1 (00:18:52,882-00:19:01,348): Is it a thing where you have to figure out what your body can do? Because, obviously, overtraining is an issue with fighters too. Have you ever had a fight where you felt like you overtrained for it?
Speaker 0 (00:19:01,348-00:19:23,865): Not not as a professional. In the amateurs, yes, as a young amateur coming up. I did fuel certain times while I ever train, but the I think the reason is, as an amateur, your fighting so constant Mhmm. And you might have 3 fights in 1 week, and then you got 2 fights the week after. But in the professional ranks, I've always been very smart, got a good team around me, and I made sure that every preparation is is pinpoint.
Speaker 0 (00:19:24,344-00:19:36,808): And a lot of people were thinking I was gonna burn you out for this fight and overtrained because it was such a long, you know, preparation, nearly 10 months. Yeah. But I said, look, I got a good time. I know what I'm doing. I know how my body feels.
Speaker 0 (00:19:37,108-00:19:48,080): If I started to feel a little bit rundown and and burning up, I pulled back, but you're fine for the biggest pricing boxing. How can he put your foot off the pedal? This is this is everything. This is gonna change my life.
Speaker 1 (00:19:48,159-00:20:03,609): Well, you did it perfectly in as far as your preparation because you were in tip top shape in the 12th round. You know, you you never lost any steam, you never lost any endurance, and the way you bounce back from that knockdown in the 10th really showed what kind of conditioning you had.
Speaker 0 (00:20:03,609-00:20:15,822): And the and the I think that the conditioning there, especially to bounce back after being put in that get getting put down, is it shows Yeah. Because if if I wasn't condition, I wouldn't be able to survive that that realm.
Speaker 1 (00:20:16,202-00:20:43,406): Yeah. When you think of, like, preparation for fights, you know, and you you see guys like Manny Pachell. You see guys like Floyd Mayweather. You see guys that are just always in peak condition. That that extra edge that they have that seems to be that I mean, that is there's not one elite world class fighter that you can say doesn't have that same kind of endurance and that same kind of discipline.
Speaker 0 (00:20:43,665-00:21:01,064): A 100%. I think that the elite level guys, you know, you need to have it. If you don't have that conditioning, I don't think you even get to that that elite I think you need to have that from a young from a young age, from early in your professional career to be able to have that work ethic, that relentless drive you know, to have that conditioning.
Speaker 1 (00:21:01,164-00:21:03,283): The only thing I could think that wasn't like that is
Speaker 0 (00:21:03,283-00:21:10,258): James Tony. Yeah. But his defense too was was I made as well. Mate, defensively. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:21:10,258-00:21:23,930): You watched these guys, you think, well, unbelievable. But the conditioning here was was a problem for him. Yeah. You look at the glacier, Florida, Manipakea, you know, all all the greats that have that conditioning. Mohammed, I lead to do 15 round flights.
Speaker 0 (00:21:24,050-00:21:30,206): Yeah. I was even telling the commission. Can we move it to 15 rounds? That's how, you know, condition I was all the fight.
Speaker 1 (00:21:30,206-00:21:38,091): Yeah. Well, back then, you know, the 15 round fights, they weren't just 15 round fights. They also weighed in the day of the fight, which is crazy.
Speaker 0 (00:21:38,091-00:21:42,488): And they would have probably fought through weeks before that as well. Mhmm. I bet bet. Yeah. That's real fought.
Speaker 0 (00:21:42,488-00:21:43,468): That's that's real warriors.
Speaker 1 (00:21:43,568-00:21:47,006): Rather, you go to the back to the Sugar Ray Robinson days. You've seen that a 100
Speaker 0 (00:21:47,566-00:21:48,405): Yeah. Yeah. Like, how
Speaker 1 (00:21:48,405-00:21:54,182): many different fights do you have? I think Was Robinson's record at the when you retire, I think it was close to 200 5.
Speaker 0 (00:21:54,182-00:22:09,563): It was white. It's unbelievable to I've only had 20, and I think how the preparations are. And you put your body through in house saw you are after a fight, especially a 12 round fight. To think these guys would fight and then awake or waking up later. They're flooding again.
Speaker 0 (00:22:09,563-00:22:13,662): Mhmm. Yeah. That's real warriors. That's that's that's janitorial stuff.
Speaker 1 (00:22:13,761-00:22:31,891): It really is crazy, and that's one of the things that the old timers always point to when when you try to make a a judgment call of, like, who's the greatest of all time. Yeah. They always point to Robinson. They're, like, just the year amount. I think he was some something crazy like 90 and o before he lost his first fight.
Speaker 1 (00:22:31,891-00:22:43,904): 201. He lost a Joey Archer in 65 that was his 200 and 1st fight. That is crazy, man. It's 3 fights, and I'll and I'll Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:22:43,904-00:22:44,984): 2 weeks, 4 a house.
Speaker 1 (00:22:44,984-00:22:48,042): And he was 44. Great.
Speaker 0 (00:22:48,062-00:22:50,081): That that that they're just saying that is
Speaker 1 (00:22:50,769-00:23:00,595): unbelievable. I mean, just unbelievable. If you go way back, Jamie, go I think it was, like, close to his 100th fight before he had his first loss.
Speaker 0 (00:23:02,674-00:23:03,174): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:23:03,873-00:23:15,146): I think he I think he lost the LaMada Okay. What year what number was that? So these are I guarantee these are all wins. So the draw was okay. 41.
Speaker 1 (00:23:15,166-00:23:24,471): Okay. So it's 41 fights. So that was Lemada. He lost Lemada, and then came back and beat him. But just what a what a That's incredible guy.
Speaker 0 (00:23:24,471-00:23:40,102): Absolutely incredible to to think that you know, this grate had over 200 flights and would fight in every couple weeks Yeah. And had 15 round fights. You know, it's it's incredible. But that's that's the rule fighters back then. I love that.
Speaker 0 (00:23:40,102-00:23:41,850): I love the the history of our sport.
Speaker 1 (00:23:41,929-00:23:48,086): Yeah, they certainly were real fighters, but it's also not the best way for your body Yeah. And your brain.
Speaker 0 (00:23:48,086-00:24:01,619): Yeah. Right? Because, you know, like, the punishment you take in a fight, you know, you need to be able to recover. Yeah. Now you think that then 14201 votes, 202 votes that he had, and be fighting every couple weeks.
Speaker 1 (00:24:01,878-00:24:02,238): Right.
Speaker 0 (00:24:02,238-00:24:05,137): You know, that potty is is taking a lot of punishment, that brain.
Speaker 1 (00:24:05,477-00:24:12,143): I know. It's crazy. It's it's crazy. It's crazy to think of. And the end of his life was not wasn't the best.
Speaker 1 (00:24:12,143-00:24:22,798): Mhmm. You know, when you when you see guys like that that stay in too long, like Ali Yeah. Like a lot of these guys, Do you do you have it mapped out when you're gonna exit the sport?
Speaker 0 (00:24:23,017-00:24:33,181): Yeah. Look. I've seen it Tom and Tom again. Even even the great many pukyo, my good friend, that last flight that he had it. I wanted to cry watching it because I know how great he is.
Speaker 0 (00:24:33,181-00:24:40,417): I know what he's done. To see that flight, just the shots weren't coming off. The feet the footwork wasn't there. The foot was slow.
Speaker 1 (00:24:40,417-00:24:43,645): But don't you think that fight was kinda the whole thing was fucked because he
Speaker 0 (00:24:43,685-00:24:44,284): Well, you did the
Speaker 1 (00:24:44,284-00:24:45,883): last minute change of opponents.
Speaker 0 (00:24:45,883-00:24:52,000): He was a difficult preparation because he prepared for spins and all of a sudden, you know, uggers. Yeah. And I came in, and
Speaker 1 (00:24:52,000-00:24:53,209): uggers' clever.
Speaker 0 (00:24:53,209-00:24:54,329): He's a very good fighter.
Speaker 1 (00:24:54,329-00:24:55,148): Very fighter.
Speaker 0 (00:24:55,248-00:25:02,783): Cuban school. You know, man. That stall that he has, and he can brawl too. He can fought. So, you know, he got him got him at a good time as well.
Speaker 0 (00:25:02,783-00:25:15,466): Everything everything should've perfect for August that night. But when you said there's other legends, you know, Roy Jones, Mhmm. Muhammad Ali Yeah. They get that extra step. And it's hard for a photo as much as you wanna get out.
Speaker 0 (00:25:15,466-00:25:17,694): You think about, okay. When can I get out?
Speaker 1 (00:25:17,694-00:25:18,214): Right. You
Speaker 0 (00:25:18,214-00:25:34,303): know, get as much as you can from the sport and win your championships and get out. But with Otis, you know, Like I said this weekend, when I was at the I need their spot. I said, I feel good. I feel a Confluence, like, if someone pulls out of what, That's the point of worry in that battle mentality you'll have.
Speaker 1 (00:25:34,483-00:25:35,322): That's awesome.
Speaker 0 (00:25:35,322-00:25:36,842): I I I I I
Speaker 1 (00:25:37,201-00:25:38,300): How much weight do you got? How much weight do you got?
Speaker 0 (00:25:38,899-00:25:41,098): Not much. £10. Yeah. So how much
Speaker 1 (00:25:41,178-00:25:43,477): how many days do you need to do that and feel good?
Speaker 0 (00:25:43,657-00:25:54,081): Naturally, my body weight, it comes right load. The day before the wane, you know, a pound and a half, two pounds, a hot bath and not on there. Oh, no. The weight is easy.
Speaker 1 (00:25:54,081-00:25:54,561): That's great.
Speaker 0 (00:25:54,561-00:26:05,555): But I feel good. You know, I've been told that you should go to 1:30. Before I won these championships, you could be champion at 1:30. I said, yeah, I can be champion at 1:30. I would be champion at 1:30, but what for?
Speaker 0 (00:26:05,885-00:26:06,324): Okay. You're
Speaker 1 (00:26:06,324-00:26:07,564): just gonna stay at 135.
Speaker 0 (00:26:07,564-00:26:16,719): I'm jumping at 135, and I feel good at 135. I feel stronger at 135. I've got that extra bounce at energy. I can eat throughout the white cunt. So Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:26:16,719-00:26:28,951): And sometimes, for others wanna sacrifice, you know, that white division and and lose that extra bit but they lose himself in in the actual battle in the fight. Yeah. The fight becomes the weight cut. We've said time and time again.
Speaker 1 (00:26:28,951-00:26:30,870): Well, in the UFC, it's a bigger problem
Speaker 0 (00:26:30,870-00:26:31,110): because
Speaker 1 (00:26:31,110-00:26:35,698): there's only 8 weight classes. It's the the gaps between the weight classes are ridiculous.
Speaker 0 (00:26:35,918-00:26:44,233): Well, you look at I was looking at some photos of Connor Marigga Mhmm. When he was floating 45. 44. Yeah. Oh, skinny, awesome.
Speaker 0 (00:26:44,892-00:26:48,471): And they even cabibas well. The brutal weight cuts. Yeah. It's incredible.
Speaker 1 (00:26:49,319-00:27:03,172): It's not good. You know? I mean, it's just Connor never lost. He never never lost at 45, but also never missed weight. He made weight every time we tried at 45, but it was a rough one.
Speaker 1 (00:27:03,172-00:27:05,891): When you would see him at the weigh ins, he looked like a skeleton.
Speaker 0 (00:27:05,891-00:27:29,717): And that's when you say problem, you know, big issues in Fireflies and problems start where, you know, brain damage and then Fireflies, you know, fireflies away, and we've seen an unboxing. Because they lose all that weight. They're so dehydrated in the brain where they don't hydrate properly as well. And all of a sudden, you know, he said in the flights. They take brutal shots, and unfortunately, things happen in the flights.
Speaker 0 (00:27:29,717-00:27:39,520): So, you know, I'd rather be feeling great, be hydrated. You know? I know that I'm going to this fight, you know, that there's gonna be no issues with that and, you know, feel good.
Speaker 1 (00:27:39,759-00:27:56,841): No. I think that's the right approach to be healthy. I mean and if you look at boxing, I think the vast majority of deaths occurred when guys have caught weight. I don't think there's very many deaths at all in the heavyweight division. I think the heavyweight division is unusual in that.
Speaker 1 (00:27:56,841-00:28:03,747): You get the biggest guys with the hardest punches. Hardest punchers, and yet, yeah, the least amount of dust because they're not cutting anyway. And it's
Speaker 0 (00:28:03,747-00:28:09,444): scary, man. It is really scary. Like, I've got 3 kids. And I've got a lot of life away from boxing.
Speaker 1 (00:28:09,463-00:28:10,703): Yeah. Yeah. When you
Speaker 0 (00:28:10,703-00:28:19,948): think of that, when you go in there, you your life is on the line. You know? And all of a sudden, you're trying to make this white. Yeah. You wanna dehydrate yourself and breathe, so that more risk.
Speaker 0 (00:28:20,927-00:28:22,646): I'd rather feel comfortable, feel good.
Speaker 1 (00:28:22,646-00:28:38,517): Well, it's that balancing act. Right? You're trying to figure out what what's the best approach to be bigger and have? Maybe a little bit more horsepower behind the punches or to be healthy, and then you have more more gas tank. You can go longer.
Speaker 1 (00:28:38,517-00:28:43,114): You can push a faster pace. You're lighter on your feet. It's like It's a great example.
Speaker 0 (00:28:43,174-00:28:44,093): My fault was Lopez.
Speaker 1 (00:28:44,093-00:28:44,533): Yes. He
Speaker 0 (00:28:44,533-00:28:45,813): was the he was the bigger man.
Speaker 1 (00:28:45,813-00:28:47,232): How much do you think he cuts?
Speaker 0 (00:28:47,612-00:28:57,327): I think he cuts a fair bit. Yeah. I think probably £10, you know, a couple days out from the fight. Yeah. But I know that he puts on a lot of size too.
Speaker 0 (00:28:57,426-00:28:59,595): It was way bigger than me in that fight. He
Speaker 1 (00:28:59,595-00:29:00,794): would definitely look bigger.
Speaker 0 (00:29:00,794-00:29:14,475): Yeah. He would have put put a lot more on. But, again, it shows that, you know, it's not about the size of a fighter. Right. And the way I've always had that approach is it's about the sauce of the hot, you know, how much you want it, the wool powder, what you're ready to go for.
Speaker 0 (00:29:14,515-00:29:16,074): That's why I took into that fight.
Speaker 1 (00:29:16,074-00:29:18,672): Did you have you gone back and watched the fight?
Speaker 0 (00:29:18,672-00:29:33,753): No. You know, I have not watched the fight. The reason the reason being is When I get home, my friend my my my friends and family, I wanna sit down, have a a a watch party, and just really the moment with them That's what I wanna watch. I think that's what I'm trying to achieve. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:29:33,753-00:29:44,977): People have been asking me, why have you not watched the fight? Because I'm trying to achieve to sit back, take myself away from from the fighter, just watch it with with everyone like it's live. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to achieve with that.
Speaker 1 (00:29:44,977-00:29:46,677): Well, you're gonna enjoy it.
Speaker 0 (00:29:46,816-00:29:47,616): Oh, no. Yeah. Well
Speaker 1 (00:29:47,736-00:29:48,576): Spoiler alert.
Speaker 0 (00:29:48,576-00:29:51,744): Yeah. So it's all good for you. I'm sorry.
Speaker 1 (00:29:51,844-00:30:00,220): It does. The what what's interesting about it that I wanted to talk to you about this is the corner advice that he was getting at. Did you hear about any of that?
Speaker 0 (00:30:00,399-00:30:29,214): I have heard about that, but we knew that coming in. I knew that, you know, the corner that he has, you know, I don't wanna put in on the spot, but his father You know? It's when you're getting information and and you gotta you gotta have trust in your corner. You know? More corner is unbelievable from you know, my my my coaches Javier Santana, Mick Akya to my cupman, Mike Basil, to even my father was the 4th Jimmy Camposas, which I'll tell a funny story with that as well.
Speaker 0 (00:30:30,473-00:30:50,931): You know, you wouldn't have trust in your team because, again, you could be taking a lot of punishment And, again, as as much as you don't wanna stop the fight, I expect my corner to to have that trust and and to throw in the towel or stop the fight. Because we wanna leave that ring and go back to our kids and and and family. Yeah. He's corner. You know, they they didn't do a right job.
Speaker 0 (00:30:51,031-00:30:56,998): He's a cut man, took forever to get in the ring. You know, his his dad was given the wrong information. They had no game plan.
Speaker 1 (00:30:57,098-00:30:58,897): Yeah. The game plan was take him out.
Speaker 0 (00:30:58,897-00:31:03,914): Yep. And that that's not a game plan. We had a perfect game plan. Round by round. We executed it.
Speaker 0 (00:31:03,914-00:31:08,571): Round by round. Now these guys had no game plan, and that's, you know, that's on them.
Speaker 1 (00:31:08,591-00:31:33,008): I think after he beat La Matenko, they had this idea that he was the next superstar, and he was gonna steamroll you and steamroll everybody else. And because he's such a heavy puncher Yeah. And the way he fought like, with that super stiff jab with Loma Chango and, like, real aggressive. And the fact that he wasn't able to maintain that pace throughout the entire twelve round fight in, Lomachenko, I think it was in 11th. He put it on him a little.
Speaker 1 (00:31:33,008-00:31:38,066): He really got to him, and Lopez survived that, and then came back to win the 12th.
Speaker 0 (00:31:38,524-00:32:09,136): I knew from that fight that the size difference between myself and I'm in Shankar, obviously, I'm a lot bigger, but my speed, my explosive power the way I move and get in positions and throw, you know, punches and combinations that are are quite awkward shots, shots that you don't see. Mhmm. I knew that I would have that advantage and I was never gonna wait. I was gonna come in it like I didn't really want Yeah. Take the shots, be prepared to take shots, and obviously, you know, land my shots as well and and put him down and show him what what I'm about and get my respect, but that's on them.
Speaker 0 (00:32:09,136-00:32:18,819): They they They made a a big mistake there with with the corner. They did have a very good coach that they usually use, but I didn't have him Yeah. For whatever reason.
Speaker 1 (00:32:18,819-00:32:29,223): I was talking to my friend, radio Rahim, today. We were talking. I was he's a giant boxing fan, you know, radio. He does a lot of those interviews on YouTube and just he's a real expert.
Speaker 0 (00:32:29,223-00:32:30,063): A real good guy too.
Speaker 1 (00:32:30,063-00:32:42,536): Great guy. And we were talking, and he said something I I wholeheartedly agree with. He said, is very rare that a father son team works out Yeah. In terms of, like, trainer and boxer. It's just very rare.
Speaker 0 (00:32:42,836-00:32:55,339): It it's high because that Again, that emotion Mhmm. You know, it's it's your father and obviously the son, but it just it's it doesn't work out. You know, you said time and time again. Mhmm. My father, you know, he was a 4th.
Speaker 0 (00:32:55,799-00:33:10,241): You know, even that his job was to put the the seat in the ring Yeah. And get a bit of ice and that's it. Everything's been a little bit crazy when I started bleeding and the cup man was was screaming at my father. Wipe him up. Wipe him up.
Speaker 0 (00:33:10,480-00:33:18,355): You know? And he is like, wait a minute. My job's only this when we went through the pre flight plan. So he was like, okay. Let me get the let me find it down while I pick him up.
Speaker 0 (00:33:18,514-00:33:35,335): But, you know, when you got that head coach being your father like you do, a lot of time doesn't work. You need someone to be able to That that's the rules. That's that's that's what you gotta do. You gotta be able to, you know, respect, you know, the the trainer. And I don't think they had that Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:33:35,335-00:33:54,144): I don't think it's impossible. I think it can be done with the right personalities. But oftentimes, the the problem is it seemed like in the Lopez Corner, you know, his dad was so accustomed to Lopez just fucking everybody up Yep. That he thought that he was gonna wake up eventually and catch
Speaker 0 (00:33:54,144-00:34:01,081): and catch me in. Yeah. It's for for a certain fighters. Yeah. It works.
Speaker 0 (00:34:01,210-00:34:20,888): But when you come against a guy that was prepared to join that ring, as scary as as it is, and as much as, you know, I trust my corner. I was honestly prepared to die in that ring. I told my wife before went to the arena that I'm prepared to die tonight. If anything happens, you know, everything's for the kids and and yourself. I'm I'm here to win this fight by any means.
Speaker 0 (00:34:21,067-00:34:38,458): That's that's the corner fighter. And the shots that I took in that in that fight, I think he takes out any other lot of weight in the world. There were some big shots, but I just kept coming. You know? And I know for a fact when he did put me down around 10, and I got up and survived that round and finished that round strong as well.
Speaker 0 (00:34:38,918-00:34:56,827): And this is this is the like a Rocky Form movie. He came back into that corner and he said it to his team and he's and he's corner man that, you know, this guy's mad is still, you know, I can't put it down in him. And I know he's psychologically that would have broken him as well. That's why that round 11 was so successful. That round 11, you know, really shadowed what what I was about.
Speaker 1 (00:34:57,167-00:35:10,788): It really did. And the fact that you came out as hard in round 11 as you had in round 1, you know, and maybe even harder because you had something to prove. I mean, you were letting him know. That that knocked down is not how the rest of this fight is gonna go.
Speaker 0 (00:35:11,128-00:35:39,870): This was a testament to to myself and how hard I prepare for this fight. I just want to show how great I am, especially in the last two rounds that have been put down. And again, in life, you get put down sometimes things don't go the way you expect them to go. But you rise and you finish whatever you're trying to achieve, you know, with everything you have, you know, the the thing is too that And I lost my grandfather, you know, about two and a half months before the fight. I had my my baby as well, my son on the same day.
Speaker 0 (00:35:40,349-00:35:43,048): And I know he was there with me, my grandfather.
Speaker 1 (00:35:43,428-00:35:45,747): So the day your grandfather died, your son was born?
Speaker 0 (00:35:45,747-00:35:59,757): Yes. Well, my son was born. And then 6 hours later, my grandfather passed away, George Cambiosis. And that's in that when I got put down, and I and I just got up. Honestly, I felt like he lifted me up.
Speaker 0 (00:35:59,757-00:36:11,200): I didn't even realize I'm up again. I'm ready. You know, that that there is is Wow. Even in the dressing room, the design cameras came out and had the the flashlight. We had the the Aussie flag and the Greek flag.
Speaker 0 (00:36:11,319-00:36:22,353): We had them tied up pretty tight. Half of the group flagged Phil Phil and came down. And of a sudden, I felt this touching presence on my shoulder. I thought, okay. I looked at my father ago.
Speaker 0 (00:36:22,353-00:36:27,900): He's here. Yes. He is. And I knew at that moment that I will not be big. I am winning this fight.
Speaker 0 (00:36:28,259-00:36:31,718): You know? He's with me, and, you know, I got the job done.
Speaker 1 (00:36:31,738-00:36:37,284): Now this it it originally was not with the zone. Right? Was originally a trailer flight.
Speaker 0 (00:36:37,284-00:36:37,844): Right. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:36:37,844-00:36:39,223): What happened with all that?
Speaker 0 (00:36:39,883-00:36:51,945): Look. Everything was great until life is a deposit for COVID. Mhmm. And then everything went went downwards, you know, postponements, date changes, you know, if any changes Mhmm. As a fighter.
Speaker 0 (00:36:51,965-00:37:04,988): And, again, labels as well. We are preparing for a fight. You know, you can't expect the fight to be making weight to have the right expiring, the right preparation, and all of a sudden they said, okay. Let's move it back again. Just doesn't work that way, sir.
Speaker 1 (00:37:04,988-00:37:07,787): They tried to move it back several weeks. Right? Like, they they
Speaker 0 (00:37:08,027-00:37:21,500): yeah. Originally, we had, I think, 4 over 60 different dates. Yeah. So we had a certain date September 11th, we heard. Then we heard about October 4th, then they went to October 5th, then they went to October 6th, so
Speaker 1 (00:37:22,029-00:37:32,254): Would they changing because they they were looking for a new venue? Was it, like, that there was competition, there was something else on television that night? Like, why would they doing that?
Speaker 0 (00:37:32,254-00:37:40,031): All of them. All of them. There was, yeah, everything. There was certain NFL games. There was the baseball games.
Speaker 0 (00:37:40,279-00:37:51,224): That clash with the same night. There was venues that they all of a sudden, they would they'll change and go to another venue. So, look, that's that's on them. You know, they missed out. It's a learning curve for them.
Speaker 0 (00:37:51,224-00:38:00,618): You know, there's no disrespect. You know, it is what it is, and, you know, they were saying the fought It was they were saying a fall of the year, and they missed that on it.
Speaker 1 (00:38:00,618-00:38:03,417): Well, they got the fall of the year when it was supposed to happen.
Speaker 0 (00:38:03,417-00:38:03,617): Yes.
Speaker 1 (00:38:03,617-00:38:14,529): You know? Yeah. Now, after the fight, it was crazy when he came over and said that he thought he won, and that he thought he won. I think he won. 9 to 3 or 10 to 2, already said.
Speaker 0 (00:38:14,529-00:38:31,441): Originally, he said 11 to 2. So Well, actually, it doesn't make sense. And honestly, our beliefs can cast. Our honesty beliefs can cast because not only he said 11 to 2, but then he said, I haven't been with my son for so long. He was only born a couple days ago, so nothing made sense.
Speaker 0 (00:38:31,620-00:38:38,947): I feel that he was concussed. That's why I said you're delusional. Mhmm. But I was disrespectful. And, again, I'll go now now and get to him.
Speaker 0 (00:38:38,947-00:38:45,513): I'm I'm not here to to put him down or trash him. He's a young kid. He lost all his belts, he got paid it up. And Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:38:45,813-00:38:50,891): Sometimes that happens when you get knocked down in the first round, and you fight the rest of the fight almost on an auto pilot.
Speaker 0 (00:38:50,891-00:38:51,610): It can cost.
Speaker 1 (00:38:51,610-00:39:00,344): Yeah. Mean, that right hand was so clean. Yeah. And when you watch his eyes roll back and he sits down, then he got up and he's fighting off, easily could have been concussion.
Speaker 0 (00:39:00,344-00:39:04,262): Well, the way he looked at me too and he thought, okay. What was that?
Speaker 1 (00:39:04,262-00:39:04,762): Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:39:05,102-00:39:11,097): Shit. I'm gonna fight now. I was just yeah. I was just I said, okay. Forget the first run now.
Speaker 0 (00:39:11,097-00:39:13,435): Let's go. Now from round 2, now I wanna show you
Speaker 1 (00:39:14,034-00:39:36,333): Well, what's interesting though is now they're talking about him moving up to 1:40 because the weight cuts to brutal. So they're coming up with a a reason for why law lost. Yep. You know, they're saying that. And then on top of that, there's this new thing that they're saying that he had a nesophical tear and that his lungs were filled up and his body cavity was filled up with air.
Speaker 1 (00:39:36,552-00:39:48,065): And they were saying that he went into the fight like that, but when you go through a brutal fight like the one YouTube went through and you you hit him with how many body shots did you hit him
Speaker 0 (00:39:48,105-00:39:49,004): a lot of bodywork.
Speaker 1 (00:39:49,104-00:39:52,582): A lot of bodywork. And shots to the neck as well. I mean, you hit them everywhere.
Speaker 0 (00:39:52,582-00:39:53,082): Everywhere.
Speaker 1 (00:39:53,262-00:40:01,897): So if you're hit like, why would they assume that the terror was before the fight when you went through that brutal fight. It's so crazy.
Speaker 0 (00:40:02,716-00:40:12,961): Again, very delusional. Yeah. And There was nothing before the fall when he was screaming. You know? And the and the videos of him screaming at the post of me saying, I'm gonna eat you.
Speaker 0 (00:40:12,961-00:40:19,647): I'm gonna I'm gonna repeat. Okay. You look good there and lighting up in the press conference. And then you got a hospital or everything. Okay.
Speaker 0 (00:40:19,747-00:40:32,549): And then after the fight, you you you thought you won, 11 to 2, you know, you're you're there telling the world, and then you still got enough energy to to to do your back flip. Right. He went around on his back flip.
Speaker 1 (00:40:32,549-00:40:34,348): Yeah. Was a Safagull tear
Speaker 0 (00:40:34,348-00:40:41,003): with a with a tear. So if there was something there, Right. You wouldn't be screaming. You wouldn't be doing sex.
Speaker 1 (00:40:41,183-00:40:49,748): Yeah. It's so hard to tell because, like, is the doctor exaggerating is it something that is sustained during the fight? Who knows?
Speaker 0 (00:40:49,748-00:40:55,484): I wanna know who's the actual doctor? Yes. Hello. It is what it is. There's been a lot of excuses and
Speaker 1 (00:40:55,883-00:41:00,201): He didn't fight like a guy who was compromised. Like, his his endurance was compromised
Speaker 0 (00:41:00,441-00:41:06,347): Right. Because he ran 10. Around 10, he he landed that shot. He was still coming the whole night. He was still throwing punches.
Speaker 0 (00:41:06,347-00:41:19,428): Yeah. But when you're getting, you know, barely, you know, attacked and Shmois shots are landing and the bodywork that I was landing, you know, and the placement of the shots Well, you're gonna fill all types of ways. Yeah. So
Speaker 1 (00:41:19,628-00:41:20,648): All kinds of damage.
Speaker 0 (00:41:20,747-00:41:39,526): The funny thing is they, you know, to don't say Wala when he came out with his excuses, and they bashed him online about that. Yeah. They came out so vocal. Doing the same thing. But the the champion that I am, I respect them, you know, all the best to whatever they do in the future.
Speaker 0 (00:41:39,925-00:41:55,746): If they wanna, you know, give me my praise, respect me, so be it. And the kind of person I am through a mutual, you know, person that we both know, I sent the video to him, you know, wish him all the best. You know, he'll up with the cut. This was before anything had come out. Mhmm.
Speaker 0 (00:41:55,746-00:42:07,810): You know, I knew the face would be pretty pretty damaged. And just to keep going because you hear things that you guys don't wanna fight no more. So, you know, you're a talented kid. You just break up and Shankar. You knock that Richard Comey.
Speaker 0 (00:42:07,890-00:42:15,806): Yeah. Bit of these guys. Again, one loss doesn't define you. So the kind of person I am, I reached out. Did I receive anything back?
Speaker 0 (00:42:15,806-00:42:17,784): No. What are
Speaker 1 (00:42:17,784-00:42:42,841): you gonna do? With the thought of him moving up to £140, which is interesting because, you know, post fight when there's a fight like that, it takes a while for the dust to settle, especially when you, you know, he he got hit with a lot of big shots and he's badly cut and battered. When the dust settles, if he chooses to go up to 140, do you see yourself ever fighting at 140?
Speaker 0 (00:42:43,639-00:43:01,150): At this stage of so much unfinished business at 135, because I'll make the weight so so good, you know, there's no vision of 140 right now. Yeah. But once I take all these guys out, the Haynes, Jeuveau Davis. You know, Ron, I see if he gets sacked together and starts fighting. Lominchenko.
Speaker 0 (00:43:01,769-00:43:14,662): That's my plan to take them all out. And even in the next fight, there will be no tune up fight. It'll be straight in there again, I guess, a big, big name. So Once we we handle that business, then we'll look at moving up moving up to 1:40.
Speaker 1 (00:43:14,842-00:43:16,282): Did you watch Jovante's fight?
Speaker 0 (00:43:16,282-00:43:16,921): I was there.
Speaker 1 (00:43:16,921-00:43:18,320): Oh, were you there? Oh, okay.
Speaker 0 (00:43:18,320-00:43:31,413): You know, and the crazy thing was you know, before the flight, they they showed the cameras, and they're showing all the basketball players there. And all of a sudden, they showed me and the applause that I've got. I couldn't believe it. This is unbelievable. This is crazy.
Speaker 1 (00:43:31,413-00:43:32,732): You're a star now, man.
Speaker 0 (00:43:32,732-00:43:44,625): It's growing. It's growing, but, you know, it's it's been that the way I looked at it was, you know, I was I was a rough cut diamond. You know, I knew what I had. Yeah. My team knew what we had, and he just had to keep polishing it.
Speaker 0 (00:43:44,705-00:43:53,979): And keep shining, and now it's shining in the Wilkinson, like I said, the person I am, you know, I'm I'm more confident fighter. But outside of the ring, Well, the man
Speaker 1 (00:43:53,979-00:44:02,415): who I am. Your performance was so good. Thank you. Now when you see what happened with Lopez, when he beat Lumachenko, it was a kind of a similar thing.
Speaker 0 (00:44:02,415-00:44:02,735): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:44:02,855-00:44:10,651): Right? Like, that made him. That that's what made his star rise. And then you came along and took the star. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:44:10,651-00:44:18,477): I took the star. You ruined the party. But what do you think is the big fight in that division? Is it Jovante?
Speaker 0 (00:44:19,016-00:44:23,854): I think hang your hang your tank. Yeah. And then it'd be nice.
Speaker 1 (00:44:23,854-00:44:24,494): Either one.
Speaker 0 (00:44:24,494-00:44:25,093): Either one.
Speaker 1 (00:44:25,093-00:44:30,431): Yeah. Now they're all fighting. It's really interesting because everyone's on kind of the same schedule.
Speaker 0 (00:44:30,480-00:44:31,379): Which is fantastic.
Speaker 1 (00:44:31,679-00:44:33,078): Everyone's fighting within the month.
Speaker 0 (00:44:33,078-00:44:46,120): We started it. I started the the the big fight. Mhmm. You know? And I gave a fight of the year, then I was at the hainy fight, watch your ring site, and we had our little chat as well after the fight with the with the cameras there.
Speaker 0 (00:44:46,240-00:44:51,957): Which was all respect. You know? Mhmm. And then I was at the tank fire as well. And I know he walked past.
Speaker 0 (00:44:51,957-00:45:06,648): He could see me there with, like, the the cameras and everyone, you know, trying to get interviews, and he went off and do what it's we'll see. You know? You know, the bores in in my court. I get to pick, but also, they need to present now. Who wants to fought?
Speaker 0 (00:45:06,648-00:45:08,468): Yeah. He's gotta be presented now.
Speaker 1 (00:45:08,727-00:45:12,786): Does did they get a medical analysis of Jovante's hand?
Speaker 0 (00:45:13,674-00:45:19,791): I'm not sure yet. Yeah. So that that there is probably gonna be an issue, but I hope that the hand is is is okay.
Speaker 1 (00:45:19,791-00:45:20,951): Yeah. Hopefully, it's not a big deal.
Speaker 0 (00:45:20,951-00:45:27,357): Because if We do go with with tank. You know, I don't wanna have more excuses. I'm sick of hearing excuses from this place.
Speaker 1 (00:45:28,456-00:45:32,143): Yeah. Well, that's to me well, either way, Haney's amazing too.
Speaker 0 (00:45:32,143-00:45:32,463): Yeah. They
Speaker 1 (00:45:32,463-00:45:33,263): would they'd be a fan
Speaker 0 (00:45:33,263-00:45:44,456): of it. They'd be a great artist. They'd it might be a great artist as well. Yes. You know, I'm so privileged to to be the the champion right now at this, you know, division, £135 is the hardest division in the world.
Speaker 0 (00:45:44,456-00:45:47,475): Really? So to be to be ruling it in the emperor at the division,
Speaker 1 (00:45:47,535-00:45:48,195): the emperor.
Speaker 0 (00:45:48,214-00:45:49,614): Because you got the 4 kings.
Speaker 1 (00:45:49,614-00:45:50,533): Yeah. So Right.
Speaker 0 (00:45:50,573-00:45:56,290): We came out with a with a quarter of the thing that that can be the 4 kings, but the emperor in our ways and more.
Speaker 1 (00:45:56,290-00:46:11,702): I like it. Now when, you know, you you look at that division. I mean, the it's arguable that that's the most stacked division in boxing. Yeah. With Lomachenko, is he gonna drop down to 1:30, or is he gonna fight he's gonna remain at 135?
Speaker 1 (00:46:12,122-00:46:14,420): Because he's a smallest guy in the division. Right?
Speaker 0 (00:46:14,460-00:46:23,615): Yeah. He's a smaller guy. Obviously, he's come from 126 Mhmm. 130. And I give him a lot of respect because he brought most of them belts to the lopez fight.
Speaker 0 (00:46:23,615-00:46:31,221): Yeah. So, you know, he doesn't he does deserve a shot as well. But as well, he did lose the lopes. So He's fighting him soon. Right?
Speaker 0 (00:46:31,221-00:46:38,246): He's fighting this weekend. Oh, this weekend against Richard Comey who was the one that our lamp is knocked down in around 2 to capture his first title.
Speaker 1 (00:46:38,246-00:46:44,893): Okay. So he's fighting another £135 fight. And is this just a is it a 10 rounder or is it a 12 rounder?
Speaker 0 (00:46:44,893-00:46:48,131): I believe it's a 12 rounder, non total 4. Non total 5. Non total 5.
Speaker 1 (00:46:48,131-00:46:58,055): And because I know that he had talked after Lopez fight about possibly going back down to 1:30, but he was another one. He thought he won that fight. Yeah. Which is crazy.
Speaker 0 (00:46:58,194-00:47:08,867): No. Lopez won that fight. As much as the lead up, I was taking shots at Lopez and saying I was a close fight. You know, maybe a draw. He was injured, whatever it was, but he did win the fight.
Speaker 1 (00:47:08,867-00:47:19,752): Yeah. I just I mean, to to deny that Lopez controlled most of the fight seems to me to be kinda silly. And to hear from Norma Schenkel was kind of surprising. I thought.
Speaker 0 (00:47:19,752-00:47:33,584): And again too, he came out with, you know, the excuses which it made him look worse because he put out the videos of the highlights and showed the world Mhmm. Look what I did, but the world saw. Yeah. So I've always been that You lose? Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:47:33,644-00:47:41,070): If it comes one day, take it on the chin. You beat me. You know, take it like a man. Yeah. Why is that they they they can't accept it?
Speaker 1 (00:47:41,150-00:47:45,348): I wanna fight it to come out of a fight and then put the highlights of his opponent punch. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:47:45,348-00:47:46,727): Punch the shit out of him.
Speaker 1 (00:47:47,267-00:47:50,084): Don't he ever does that. No. Like, we saw that part too, man.
Speaker 0 (00:47:50,084-00:47:59,598): Yeah. Well Yeah. The world saw it, and that's why with lipist coming out and saying, I want to fight the whole world, whatever, sore blah blah blah. So man, the whole world saw this. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:47:59,598-00:48:08,044): You know, the arena, your own fans are booing you now. Mhmm. And that's a crazy crazy thing too because when I walked inside that arena, I was getting booed a lot crazy.
Speaker 1 (00:48:08,424-00:48:15,729): Yeah. But that's the thing about Brooklyn, man. If you if you're fighting a Brooklyn fighter, you know, you're gonna get booed, but if you beat them, they're gonna
Speaker 0 (00:48:15,729-00:48:16,288): cheer you.
Speaker 1 (00:48:16,288-00:48:17,728): They're gonna cheer you. You won them all.
Speaker 0 (00:48:17,728-00:48:32,789): And that's what I did. I stood on that ring before I entered the the ropes inside. And I just stared at him like a Gladiator, like a Roman Gladiator, like a Spider Warrior, like a Sam Booyne, they're doing all types of stuff. I said, okay. You boo me now.
Speaker 0 (00:48:32,809-00:48:50,799): But I tell you, by the end of this fight, you're gonna applaud. And when that round 12 was done, I stood on the on the ropes, and I'm bleeding, and Eddie earns it clapping like you couldn't believe it like a little kid and I'm wiping the blood off my face and I'm showing the crowd and say this is for you guys. Wow. They're going crazy. That's I'm old school.
Speaker 1 (00:48:51,498-00:49:10,268): You talked about the difficulty in coming from Australia and getting over here and and competing. Do you think that you'll set up your next training camp here and bring everybody over in advance? Would that make it easier if you're fighting here? Or Do you think you could lure somebody to Australia for a big money fight? Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:49:10,287-00:49:10,727): Which I
Speaker 1 (00:49:10,727-00:49:15,134): mean, you'd probably sell out a fucking giant arena in Australia right now. Right?
Speaker 0 (00:49:15,134-00:49:20,711): Australia is a plan. You know, I think I've I've I've earned that. I deserve that. I've been on the race since 2017.
Speaker 1 (00:49:21,589-00:49:22,909): Yeah. You'll need one at home. Right?
Speaker 0 (00:49:22,909-00:49:32,393): I need one at home, and look. You got the beautiful mobile stadium. They had had a had a Sonya and Whittaker there. Yeah. You know, that there will be 70, 80,000 people will be packed to the rafters.
Speaker 0 (00:49:32,393-00:49:44,036): You know? Melbourne. Melbourne is fantastic because there's 600,000 Greeks It's the 2nd biggest Greek population outside of Athens. Really? So he'd be such a crowd a proud Greek.
Speaker 1 (00:49:44,036-00:49:44,536): Mhmm.
Speaker 0 (00:49:44,716-00:49:51,952): They had gone nuts back home. They are smashing every plate they have. You know, it's been been crazy. So that is the plan. I know Haney's up front.
Speaker 0 (00:49:52,171-00:50:02,105): I know Lomachenko is up front. Tank. I don't know if he wants to come to Australia. I don't even know if he can get into Australia to be honest. Well, he has a lot of, you know, certain charges on on himself
Speaker 1 (00:50:02,145-00:50:03,064): Oh, doesn't he?
Speaker 0 (00:50:03,064-00:50:06,542): I don't know if he can get in there, but we'll see. You know?
Speaker 1 (00:50:06,542-00:50:11,070): Yeah. Do you have a preference the fight that you think would be the bigger fight?
Speaker 0 (00:50:11,270-00:50:12,069): All of them. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:50:12,069-00:50:12,389): All of
Speaker 0 (00:50:12,389-00:50:30,898): them, it just again, 2 of them had have had their their fights. Did they show a lot because I was looking for excitement, entertainment, I feel like I put a lot of pressure. My presence just been there and, you know, I kinda feel bad for the Hany day as flight work because when I rocked up into Vegas, it was all about me. You know? I kinda feel bad.
Speaker 0 (00:50:30,898-00:50:37,595): And even, like, when they had their post what press conference they wanted me, and then I said, no. I'm not going in there because it's their time. Let them enjoy their moment.
Speaker 1 (00:50:38,485-00:50:40,864): I watched that fight for the first time today in the gym.
Speaker 0 (00:50:40,923-00:50:44,522): It was it was a good fight. He's very sharp. Meaning, he boxes very nice,
Speaker 1 (00:50:44,522-00:50:45,121): and Diaz,
Speaker 0 (00:50:45,121-00:50:56,814): but Diaz wants him to work. And Diaz is not a a a natural £135, though. He's small. So when you put someone like like me, he's fast and strong and a lot bigger. It's it's a different story.
Speaker 1 (00:50:56,814-00:51:00,012): Well, it it's an exciting matchup with either one of those 3.
Speaker 0 (00:51:00,012-00:51:00,772): It really is.
Speaker 1 (00:51:00,772-00:51:13,855): The the compelling thing about Lomachenko is Lomachenko's that defeat to Lopez was kinda shocking to a lot of people. And having you just beating Lopez, he has the opportunity to kinda get it back A little.
Speaker 0 (00:51:13,895-00:51:14,614): Going back Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:51:14,614-00:51:17,573): Yeah. If he could get you. And, also, he's a giant name.
Speaker 0 (00:51:17,573-00:51:25,698): Yeah. He he really is. And, again, you know, any one of these free guys Yeah. Australia. Marvelous name is gonna it's gonna be a sold out attendance.
Speaker 1 (00:51:26,118-00:51:27,517): Yeah. I
Speaker 0 (00:51:27,597-00:51:40,509): It's a beautiful rainer. That rain is beautiful in the way it it's it's set. Where it's can be open for the undercard and the the domain. And then on the main event to be closed, I've already envisioned it. I've already
Speaker 1 (00:51:40,509-00:51:41,828): here already. Sound even more.
Speaker 0 (00:51:41,828-00:51:45,726): Can you give us a feel like I'm not Tom for the broadcast. Very good.
Speaker 1 (00:51:46,364-00:51:46,964): Listen, man.
Speaker 0 (00:51:46,964-00:51:48,803): I love I gotta get you there. We gotta get you there.
Speaker 1 (00:51:48,803-00:51:51,322): Love to go, but that 16 hour flight can kiss my ass.
Speaker 0 (00:51:51,322-00:51:54,840): Yeah. It's a and I got it tonight. I'm flying back home tonight.
Speaker 1 (00:51:55,240-00:52:04,824): I've done it a bunch of times. I did a bunch of UFC cards over there. It's rough, and you just be wildered for weeks afterwards. You're you're so confused. And I wanted to talk to you about that.
Speaker 1 (00:52:04,824-00:52:11,961): Like, what is that like when you do your preparation and then you come over here for a fight? How much time do you have to give yourself?
Speaker 0 (00:52:13,169-00:52:37,076): Usually, in my my last flights, I've been here for 8 weeks, 10 weeks, you know, at points, I bring my whole family, my kids over. But for the start of this preparation, obviously, for 4 months before he tested positive for COVID, you know, obviously by myself, and then why our father and Australian coach came over. So we had the preparation here. We're accustomed to the time difference. Everything was perfect.
Speaker 0 (00:52:37,935-00:52:45,660): Then when he tested positive for COVID, I said, I don't know how long he's gonna be till he's ready to get inside the reps again. Yeah. Just gonna take forever.
Speaker 1 (00:52:45,740-00:52:46,019): Right.
Speaker 0 (00:52:46,019-00:52:52,196): I can't just stop my life. I gotta get back home. I gotta go be with my kids. I gotta be a father. So we flew back home.
Speaker 0 (00:52:52,256-00:53:03,669): We've done that bloody quarantine for 2 weeks. Which is not easy and then, you know, continue preparation in Australia. Then I flew back two and a half weeks out Well, this is quite
Speaker 1 (00:53:03,669-00:53:03,989): a lot.
Speaker 0 (00:53:03,989-00:53:09,806): So it wasn't a lot, but I knew because I've done this trip so many times that my body would be accustomed.
Speaker 1 (00:53:09,995-00:53:12,953): Is it harder to go back there or to come over here?
Speaker 0 (00:53:12,953-00:53:15,252): It's harder to go back. They say that.
Speaker 1 (00:53:15,312-00:53:18,700): I've heard that. I've Someone tried to explain that to me, and I don't understand it.
Speaker 0 (00:53:18,780-00:53:30,992): I found that coming here because you don't lose any time. You need to leave 10 in the morning in Australia. And by the time you get here, it's still the same day, 6 or 7 in the morning. So Which
Speaker 1 (00:53:30,992-00:53:32,032): is fucking crazy.
Speaker 0 (00:53:32,032-00:53:37,948): It's unbelievable. It's like I could train. I could train. I thought about this. How mad I am with my training.
Speaker 0 (00:53:38,207-00:53:46,582): I could train just before I get on that flight, and I can get to LA. And I can train against him as I've done 2 sessions and lost no time. It's unbelievable.
Speaker 1 (00:53:46,842-00:53:53,348): Yeah. That's crazy. And when you do that, do you try to train the moment you land just to kinda kill
Speaker 0 (00:53:53,348-00:53:53,908): that away.
Speaker 1 (00:53:53,908-00:53:55,408): Straight away. Kill that lag.
Speaker 0 (00:53:55,507-00:54:00,894): I need to try, and I need to sweat. Mhmm. You know, I gotta bet I have a good sleep. And I'm up. I feel great.
Speaker 1 (00:54:00,894-00:54:04,932): That seems the only way to settle it is a hard workout. Right?
Speaker 0 (00:54:04,932-00:54:13,057): Yeah. You need to have that hard workout. And I've told guys coming over. Because I've done it so many times. I said, as soon as you land, don't sleep as much as you wanna sleep.
Speaker 0 (00:54:13,317-00:54:19,852): Do not sleep. Just do a live session. Just shut out box for for 3, 4 rands. Go for a little jog. Just get something going.
Speaker 0 (00:54:19,852-00:54:30,587): Mhmm. Now your body can start to to tick over. It's crazy how the body is Yeah. To think that a small workout like that and get you set and, you know, I hope with the, you know, the jet lag.
Speaker 1 (00:54:30,587-00:54:36,624): Yeah. There's something about the circadian rhythm apparently that gets reset Yeah. By a brutal workout,
Speaker 0 (00:54:36,763-00:54:37,643): some believe. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (00:54:37,643-00:54:42,379): And they also say you try you should try to not eat on the flight. Mhmm. I've never done.
Speaker 0 (00:54:42,379-00:54:47,996): Yeah. Well, the plain food. Yeah. I don't I don't touch that anyway because that that stuff is that's brutal.
Speaker 1 (00:54:48,176-00:54:49,485): Do you bring your own food?
Speaker 0 (00:54:49,685-00:55:03,847): I bring, yeah, small snacks and watch I hydrate a lot. Yeah. So coming over, you know, I was hydrating with with the stuff that I take. Nonstop, you know, like, I had maybe 3, 4 liters on that flight.
Speaker 1 (00:55:03,847-00:55:05,906): Oh my god. It must be fine.
Speaker 0 (00:55:06,046-00:55:10,723): Now once it hit, I was like, wow, man. And what's trailing coaches looking at me guys
Speaker 1 (00:55:10,723-00:55:11,802): again? Alright.
Speaker 0 (00:55:11,802-00:55:13,442): It was only, like, 10 minutes ago.
Speaker 1 (00:55:13,442-00:55:14,660): Yeah. And that's
Speaker 0 (00:55:14,660-00:55:19,137): the the the people in the painting is sky. Right? Why is it caught up and down? Right. It's a little
Speaker 1 (00:55:19,137-00:55:19,737): cock in the back.
Speaker 0 (00:55:19,737-00:55:20,517): No. It's sunny.
Speaker 1 (00:55:20,856-00:55:23,655): Are you are you very strict with your diet?
Speaker 0 (00:55:23,655-00:55:24,315): Very trick.
Speaker 1 (00:55:24,315-00:55:27,613): Yeah. Very strict. What's what's a a normal meal like for you?
Speaker 0 (00:55:28,073-00:55:45,583): You know, I have a a high protein, semi chicken, my turkey, you know, lean beef, And then I want my complex carbs, you know, my sweet potato, my pumpkin, you know, some brown rice, sikimua. And then from there, Yeah. My salad, my veggies. Yeah. That's it.
Speaker 0 (00:55:45,583-00:55:47,023): Yeah. Cleaning. Super clean.
Speaker 1 (00:55:47,023-00:55:49,262): Do you have someone prepare meals for
Speaker 0 (00:55:49,262-00:55:59,406): you? Not really. My wife, obviously, when when when when we're at home together. But when I'm here, I'm doing most of it myself, and I enjoy it. You know, I love the aspect of the nutrition.
Speaker 0 (00:55:59,845-00:56:17,374): You know, eating right, getting the right fuel into your body because a lot of foreigners, they train unbelievable, but all of a sudden they stuff up on the nutrition. That stuff up with the post weighing, you know, the right mills. It's straight off of the weighing. I had my hydration, and I had a mill ready to go. Mhmm.
Speaker 0 (00:56:17,394-00:56:23,210): Turkey, my avocado. You know, the good fats, the good protein. You have to put all the good stuff back into me.
Speaker 1 (00:56:23,569-00:56:27,828): Now have you worked with the nutrition to develop this meal plan or
Speaker 0 (00:56:27,847-00:56:53,021): very early in in my career? Think I still an amateur. I did get to a nutritionist, learn a couple facts, and then the rest was just my my own study, throw an error. You know, it's they're in know, I'd have a I know I'd have a big expiring session, you know, on a certain date, and I'd work on things letting into that expiring session stay. I feel So you can have a nutritionist, you can have a dietitian team, but it depends how your body feels.
Speaker 0 (00:56:53,260-00:56:56,298): You know, what my work for you, my work for me to
Speaker 1 (00:56:56,298-00:56:56,958): say Right.
Speaker 0 (00:56:57,058-00:57:07,592): You know, I've I've come to a point where I know exactly what I gotta do to make the wet, to have the right energy. But again, I'm always happy to learn. That's why I studied so much on it, and I'm always happy to to learn more and more.
Speaker 1 (00:57:07,592-00:57:15,467): And how did you come to turkey and chicken do you did you try seafood? Have you try do you eat meat? Like, red meat?
Speaker 0 (00:57:15,467-00:57:25,180): I do. I eat meat. I I read meat. I just love taking chicken the high protein about it. You know, it just sits good in my stomach, but as well, a lot of prawns as well.
Speaker 0 (00:57:25,299-00:57:30,017): Prongs. Yeah. Because they're a high protein Mhmm. Low calorie. You know?
Speaker 0 (00:57:30,017-00:57:39,133): So that there, I was having a fair bit leading into this fight. And it was unbelievable with a weight That best I've ever felt felt, ages have ever ever made weight. And
Speaker 1 (00:57:39,412-00:57:41,192): What's like the heaviest you ever get?
Speaker 0 (00:57:41,611-00:57:43,569): Probably 140 7.
Speaker 1 (00:57:43,569-00:57:44,009): Oh, that's
Speaker 0 (00:57:44,009-00:57:52,244): not bad at all. I checked my weight 2 days ago, and, obviously, I've been eating a little bit more now Yeah. Because I just had a a big win. I think I was at 1:40. I was at 1:44.
Speaker 0 (00:57:52,663-00:57:54,182): Oh. Yeah. So my pounds.
Speaker 1 (00:57:54,182-00:57:54,662): Not bad.
Speaker 0 (00:57:54,662-00:58:00,939): It's crazy. I can make the weight. That's why I said to Eddie, if you wanna put me on. Pull one of these guys out. Oh, really serious.
Speaker 0 (00:58:00,939-00:58:05,776): Oh, serious. Because you got stitches. I could know about these stitches. Let it open up, makes the fight even better.
Speaker 1 (00:58:05,776-00:58:14,211): It's hilarious. Imagine if you actually did that. Imagine if, like, someone's opponent fell out and you had to step in. I'm that short of notice.
Speaker 0 (00:58:14,211-00:58:21,467): Imagine using the same fight shorts full blood. Life was his blood. My blood. Whoever was gonna fight their blood.
Speaker 1 (00:58:21,467-00:58:23,466): Well, that would be a great story.
Speaker 0 (00:58:23,466-00:58:23,945): Very cool.
Speaker 1 (00:58:23,945-00:58:27,063): And, you know, also maximize your time before you have to go back home.
Speaker 0 (00:58:27,063-00:58:29,862): Yep. Or you might as well. Yeah. You Yeah. You've got that big trip.
Speaker 0 (00:58:29,862-00:58:33,330): So if you can get 2 flights in Right. You can make the trip worth it.
Speaker 1 (00:58:33,490-00:58:38,287): Yeah. For sure. Do you take any supplements, vitamins, anything like that?
Speaker 0 (00:58:38,287-00:58:48,500): A lot of vitamins. Yeah. Yeah. And my my immune boosters, my vitamin c's, my b12's, my sink, fish oils, all all all the good stuff
Speaker 1 (00:58:48,540-00:58:52,098): And have you learned this from nutritionists, or is this trial and error?
Speaker 0 (00:58:52,098-00:58:53,177): Is it trial and error?
Speaker 1 (00:58:53,177-00:58:54,297): Maybe research online.
Speaker 0 (00:58:54,297-00:58:55,376): Research, trial and error.
Speaker 1 (00:58:55,376-00:58:55,656): Yeah.
Speaker 0 (00:58:55,656-00:59:05,170): You know, I listened to to other athletes, listened to to other fighters, you know, see how it feels, introduce it. If it doesn't feel good, take it out. If it's so good, leave
Speaker 1 (00:59:05,449-00:59:15,643): Here you are now. You're you just come off this huge win when you're preparing, like, for another fight. You you know, it's gonna be a few months at least.
Speaker 0 (00:59:15,643-00:59:16,143): Yep.
Speaker 1 (00:59:16,363-00:59:26,298): What do you do in the meantime? Do you go back to work and work on, like, technical aspects your game? Do you do strength and conditioning? Do you do all the above? Like, what do you do in the downtime?
Speaker 0 (00:59:26,437-00:59:38,001): A bit of everything. Yeah. Now my my whole theory and think about is Every day I'm gonna get better and better. And I was in the gym this morning before we were here. I love it.
Speaker 0 (00:59:38,001-01:00:04,985): I love training. So The big thing now is to continue my shrink conditioning, get a little bit bigger, get a little bit stronger, I have I have room and time to be able to get bigger. I make the weight very easy, but still keep my speed and more explosive, you know, snap and pow because that is a big factor in my game. That's one thing I do. I never wanna lose, perfecting the the the punches, a little bit more, you know, work on that that shot that I landed on Lopez in round 1.
Speaker 0 (01:00:05,185-01:00:20,586): If I thought maybe a little bit more with an angle, I might have put him to sleep at that moment. Yeah. So we keep working. Is it so much more to do? You know, in that fight, the world might have thought that that they've seen the best of of cambiosis, but, you know, for me, I feel like that was 15%.
Speaker 0 (01:00:21,095-01:00:38,355): There's so much 14. Yeah. Yeah. Honestly, there was moments in that fall were so come off for that, shop for that, and they weren't coming off. So I know that there is a lot more, but Once I sit down and watch the fight, I'll be able to, you know, analyze it even more and and and game plan and, you know, get the no pulled out no no book out and go through it all.
Speaker 0 (01:00:38,474-01:00:39,434): Through other mistakes.
Speaker 1 (01:00:39,434-01:00:46,371): It's interesting because that is the mentality that makes a true champion. Yeah. Someone who's never satisfied with their performance and always wants to do better.
Speaker 0 (01:00:46,390-01:00:55,526): It is. I'm I'm never content. I just won the undisputed championship. You know, I have not even had 11 celebration drink. You know, I have I have been so focused.
Speaker 0 (01:00:55,526-01:01:03,981): I've been in Vegas. I've been in LA, I'm here now, not one celebration drink. You know, that's that's the kind of a, you know, photo I haven't dedicated to this sport.
Speaker 1 (01:01:03,981-01:01:17,223): You you got the Ring Magazine belt. Which is by many people, they think that that's probably the most unbiased of the belt. Yes. Because if you look at the regulatory bodies. They all have their own mandatory challengers.
Speaker 1 (01:01:17,483-01:01:27,966): There's a lot of shenanigans that go on with that. Is you know, so now you have the IBF, you have the WBO, and you have the Ring Magazine title.
Speaker 0 (01:01:27,966-01:01:57,480): I have the IBF. Yeah. The WBA ring magazine, WBA Super Title, which is, you know, the the best WBA built you can get. And I also have the WBC franchise built, which is to me. It's a super tall as well, and I highly has a WBSA built, and, you know, the wider WBSA has set this up is You got a super champion, a guy who, you know, cannot have any mandatories, can be able to maneuver, you know, and and and have options to do what they wanna do.
Speaker 0 (01:01:57,560-01:02:05,245): Which I like because the last thing you wanna do is be caught up in a mandatory, but doesn't make sense. Mhmm. You know, I can maneuver where I have to say,
Speaker 1 (01:02:05,285-01:02:07,643): How'd you get to become a super champion? How does that work?
Speaker 0 (01:02:07,643-01:02:10,322): Well, Lipus was a super champion. Right. Everything's there.
Speaker 1 (01:02:10,322-None): What is how does one become a super champion? What is the there there's
Speaker 0 (01:02:14,519-01:02:23,774): I think it's when you've defended the the built certain times, they elevate you to a to a point. But seems odd. Right? You you know, I'm old school. I'm old school.
Speaker 0 (01:02:23,774-01:02:33,199): Yeah. You know, I love all the belts. You know, they're they're my, you know, they're my pride now. You know, they're like my kids now. So I've got 5 new kids, you know, but I'm old school.
Speaker 0 (01:02:33,199-01:02:35,998): And if, like, an event you just have one champion
Speaker 1 (01:02:36,158-01:02:36,318): Right.
Speaker 0 (01:02:36,358-01:02:46,582): Be recognized, and that Ring Magazine does do that. The Ring Magazine is that you're the leading champion Right. You're the number one division, and that's what I am right now. But I love all the belts too. I respect that.
Speaker 0 (01:02:46,582-01:02:48,901): And it looks like cool to have all these beautiful belts.
Speaker 1 (01:02:48,901-01:02:55,488): Oh, yeah. There's nothing better than watching. I walked to the ring just showered his belts when he wins. You know, he's drapid them all over here.
Speaker 0 (01:02:55,488-01:03:01,584): Everywhere. Yeah. The problem is now trying to get back home with all these belts. It's like It's a mission.
Speaker 1 (01:03:01,584-01:03:03,383): Do you have to check them? I would never
Speaker 0 (01:03:03,383-01:03:16,136): check them. I'm not checking them with me. I'm I'm boarding them with me Yeah. When we get to the airport and Like, even yesterday, you know, we get to the airport in LA. And as we're going for customs, they open them up, they check them.
Speaker 0 (01:03:16,136-01:03:20,173): Okay. Okay. There's another one. Check it. Then the back comes.
Speaker 0 (01:03:20,173-01:03:28,469): There's another one. Okay. How many did you get? A fair few. So that's that's that's part of my my entourage now.
Speaker 1 (01:03:29,008-01:03:29,688): For sure.
Speaker 0 (01:03:29,688-01:03:38,753): I've I've worked hard to to get them and, you know, like I said, this is this is not the end. This is gonna be a long run. It's 15% of what the world saw.
Speaker 1 (01:03:39,132-01:03:56,993): Well, enjoy it and take it in because you you deserve every minute of it. So you say you work on a little bit of everything, but talk me through like a typical day in training. Are you working out twice a day? Do you do strength and conditioning, road work? Like, what is what's a normal day for you?
Speaker 0 (01:03:56,993-01:03:58,392): Usually, three sessions are there.
Speaker 1 (01:03:58,392-01:03:59,072): Three sessions.
Speaker 0 (01:03:59,072-01:04:04,268): Yeah. That's why I feel that's why I have that conditioning. You know, I have my strength conditioning early in the morning.
Speaker 1 (01:04:04,268-01:04:05,848): And what would that consist of?
Speaker 0 (01:04:06,187-01:04:52,681): All types of things, your resistance, your your your your heavy lifts, you know, your your load work where you're going down on a certain count. As you get close to the flight, your resistant bands in the speed work with explosive power, your speed and agility work, part of that air conditioning cycle in the morning. And then We go to our boxing in the afternoon, early afternoon where you're doing your pad work, aspiring, your your bag work, your game planning, your shadow boxing, everything that is involved, you know, to to get to that level of the top. And then later on, I'm running on the road, and do my roadwork. I love the roadwork especially at the end because you've put in the hard work to, you know, get up again and say, okay.
Speaker 0 (01:04:52,681-01:05:01,186): I gotta do my roadwork now. Even that I'm I'm fit, I'm ready. Push a little bit more. And why trainers have to hold me back sometimes? Like, don't do it.
Speaker 0 (01:05:01,186-01:05:10,840): You know, you're you're you're ready. But you know, I know how my body feels, and I know what what what it takes to get that next level. So so 3, yeah, 3 sessions a day is is the usual
Speaker 1 (None-01:05:13,778): did you develop the schedule of 3 sessions a day?
Speaker 0 (01:05:14,678-01:05:29,819): It's, again, trial and error. A lot of trial and error, Sarah, you know, you you as a young amateur. You know, you start off with one session a day and you see the professionals in the in the gym when you're watching them and, you know, idolize these guys. You know, you said, okay. They train it twice a day.
Speaker 0 (01:05:30,118-01:05:41,762): I gotta do 2 sessions a day, so you get that. And then as you get to the the next level, the LA level, think that I need to do more work. I need to get better and better. He got like Manny Pacquiao as well. You know, he puts in 2:3 a day.
Speaker 0 (01:05:41,762-01:05:43,859): 2:3 a day? Yeah. Pretty much every day.
Speaker 1 (01:05:43,859-01:05:47,718): When you do your strength and conditioning, do you work with a a physical trainer?
Speaker 0 (01:05:47,937-01:05:52,116): I've got yeah. I've got a strength and conditioning coach. Yeah. Yeah. Marijuana from ethos performance.
Speaker 0 (01:05:52,665-01:05:57,182): They got a couple UFC guys that you would know. Should we bam bam 2 of us?
Speaker 1 (01:05:57,182-01:05:57,702): Oh, beautiful.
Speaker 0 (01:05:57,702-01:05:58,342): Nice in Pedro.
Speaker 1 (01:05:58,342-01:05:59,381): He's fine next week, Joe.
Speaker 0 (01:05:59,381-01:06:03,089): Yeah. But this week, I I know. I wish I could go. Yeah. I would love to be there, but I need to get home.
Speaker 0 (01:06:03,089-01:06:03,809): My kids are I
Speaker 1 (01:06:03,809-01:06:04,049): get it.
Speaker 0 (01:06:04,049-01:06:11,194): They're missing dad and mom. So I'm just a good guy. He's got a really good team out there. The shrink conditioning is is very important. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:06:11,194-01:06:12,753): Massive aspect of the game.
Speaker 1 (01:06:12,753-01:06:23,077): Does that do you do different work when you're non encamped versus when you're in camp in terms of strength and conditioning. I mean, do you have specific stuff you do to ramp up for a fight?
Speaker 0 (01:06:23,077-01:06:41,655): Yep. So Now, obviously, the flight is done. Right? My goal is to get back and do heavier lifts, build that more strength, push my body to the next level, and we got every all the data, and we got everything from every past fight that I've been working with this team. And we can see the figures continually go up.
Speaker 0 (01:06:41,855-01:07:01,385): Now if them numbers and figures didn't go up in the next preparation, I don't feel right because I'm always trying to get better and better every day. So we'll put in the the heavy strings work now. Build that that power, to to build that that next level numbers. And then as the camp progresses, the date will get locked in, then we start to pinpoint. Okay.
Speaker 0 (01:07:01,835-01:07:11,899): We're sparing these certain dates. We need more speed here. We need more explicit in this in this part. We move everything as the font. And I get locked in as we we go for camp.
Speaker 1 (01:07:12,198-01:07:16,376): Is there any concern when you're doing the strength conditioning that you might put on too much weight?
Speaker 0 (01:07:17,184-01:07:24,801): Not really. No. No. And I trust the team, and my body type never really blows out too much. I can't really put on too too much.
Speaker 0 (01:07:25,230-01:07:32,526): In a mass amount of white and and muscle. So I'm always very confident that no matter what, I will make the white comfortably.
Speaker 1 (01:07:32,605-01:07:33,764): Well, especially when you want
Speaker 0 (01:07:33,764-01:07:46,117): to sell it to yeah. You can sell it. And that's right. You know, the the the strength conditioning is one aspect. But when you're boxing, you know, and you're losing so many calories, and then you're running on the road, doing your 45 minute to 1 hour roadwork.
Speaker 0 (01:07:46,755-01:07:50,453): Know, you're always gonna be in that pick condition. The body type is gonna be very similar.
Speaker 1 (01:07:50,913-01:08:01,586): Do you have specific foods that you eat right post workout? To try to recover. Because when you train 3 a day, one of the most important things is refueling your muscles before you give it a go again in a couple hours.
Speaker 0 (01:08:01,586-01:08:16,088): Well, I used to have, obviously, your protein shakes and and all the the the good stuff to get back into you, but I took it out of my system, the protein. I was like, you know what? I don't need it. My body feels great. There was a time where where I I I missed that for a few times.
Speaker 0 (01:08:16,088-01:08:23,124): And I go, you know what? I feel good. I feel better. So I took that out, you know, I rather have the good food, you know, the the the eggs. Real food.
Speaker 0 (01:08:23,124-01:08:33,998): The real food. Yeah. You know, the spinach, the the the broccoli, the the veggies. I still put in my gluten 1 with my hydration. Because it's very important, you know, to get their electric gases and get their hydration up.
Speaker 0 (01:08:34,338-01:08:38,654): But real food, you know, my body's never looked better, and I'm on real food.
Speaker 1 (01:08:38,654-01:08:50,078): Yeah. I I agree with you on the real food thing. I think the the best thing about protein shakes is when you're on the on the go and you need to get calories. Yeah. And you need protein, and you could down a shake.
Speaker 0 (01:08:50,078-01:08:50,598): But That's right.
Speaker 1 (01:08:50,798-01:08:55,416): I really prefer real food too, and I think I I prefer that athletes eat real food.
Speaker 0 (01:08:55,635-01:09:12,486): Well, the thing is too. When you're a professional and and you're working, you know, nonstop in the gym and and this is your craft, you know, I don't have to to go to a job. I don't have other work. So you take the time. You use your time management, and I learned that from many PACIA too.
Speaker 0 (01:09:12,486-01:09:19,342): Time management is is very important. The quasi senator. He'll come straight from the senate in his in his suit
Speaker 1 (01:09:19,342-01:09:20,022): right into the gym.
Speaker 0 (01:09:20,022-01:09:20,902): Straight into the gym.
Speaker 1 (01:09:20,902-01:09:21,381): That's great.
Speaker 0 (01:09:21,381-01:09:23,349): And the reps are on. Into the rounds.
Speaker 1 (01:09:23,349-01:09:23,989): That's crazy.
Speaker 0 (01:09:23,989-01:09:34,893): So the time management is very important. Yeah. And and making sure that you have the food, the the prep, you finish your session, get the right food into you. Have the the the vitamins and everything that you you take.
Speaker 1 (01:09:34,893-01:09:38,192): Do you eat a lot of fruit? Or do you eat fruit, like, pre workout
Speaker 0 (01:09:38,371-01:09:54,762): at all? I do have you a a fair bit of fruit your watermelons, your antioxidant, your your berries, you know, your your blueberries, your strawberries, your raspberries, even coconut meat, You know, I love the coconut meat. Mhmm. You know, the good fats, the good stuff into you. You know, your your your pineapple.
Speaker 0 (01:09:56,421-01:10:00,578): Everything is is it's got a it's a formula to to get to this position.
Speaker 1 (01:10:00,578-01:10:03,137): And this is, again, all stuff that you tweaked over time.
Speaker 0 (01:10:03,137-01:10:12,652): Yeah. Look at myself, draw whatever era. You know, I will try something else and I I don't feel good with that. I need this. Okay.
Speaker 0 (01:10:12,652-01:10:23,156): That's beautiful. I need it. My weight, I say where my weight bounces to. Some certain things you take and, you know, put into your system and, you know, the weight will will fluctuate to your eye. So that can no.
Speaker 0 (01:10:23,156-01:10:23,795): Don't need that
Speaker 1 (01:10:24,074-01:10:38,206): Now when it comes to recovery, when you're doing these kind of brutal workouts and you're doing something like that three times a day, Do you do anything for recovery, like, in terms of, like, massage, sauna, ice baths?
Speaker 0 (01:10:39,375-01:10:56,046): We do our massages, but the biggest thing I'm on is 3 to 4 times a week. I'm in the Epsom bath Mhmm. Hot bath, Epsom salts. I know that, you know, the ice baths are a big thing, but, you know, I just couple myself in that ice. Really?
Speaker 0 (01:10:56,046-01:11:07,658): It's just cold. Yeah. I just I hate it. I used to do it as a young kid, as an amateur used to love it, but I think because I got so hooked on the Epsom Soul bus and the heat, my body body can't deal with the cold now. Really?
Speaker 0 (01:11:07,658-01:11:18,872): You know, I said that. But, again, I do try to have the cold showers. You know, I started learning a little bit more about Winthrop, you know, saying the cold start with the cold showers and you start to get better and better with us. So Yeah. But we're half
Speaker 1 (01:11:18,952-01:11:20,711): so you needed to go into the plunge.
Speaker 0 (01:11:20,711-01:11:29,635): Yeah. Yeah. So that's what you said, look, you gotta start with the showers first, and then you make your way. So hopefully, in another couple of weeks, I'll be able to get back in the in the cold baths.
Speaker 1 (01:11:29,755-01:11:31,513): It's interesting that you used to do it.
Speaker 0 (01:11:31,513-01:11:37,850): Yeah. It's crazy as an amateur. Yeah. And I'll do it. And, you know, when I was in Sydney, we got the baths there in the gym.
Speaker 0 (01:11:37,970-01:11:46,364): This gym is unbelievable, you know, just boxing, and they've set up actually a hot bar from a cold bar with an ice machine, everything, pretty much for for me.
Speaker 1 (01:11:46,624-01:11:47,104): Oh, nice.
Speaker 0 (01:11:47,104-01:11:56,289): And, you know, after a session, they got it set up. Okay. It'll be easy, but alright. No problem. But I hadn't done it for a while, you know, for a long time, actually.
Speaker 0 (01:11:56,868-01:12:06,403): So when I got in there, I was in there for about 30 seconds. And I'm like, hopper ventilator, I gotta get out I gotta actually get out. You're a base. What's wrong? Everyone's like, what's wrong with you?
Speaker 0 (01:12:06,403-01:12:16,436): You've fought all these guys. I said, I didn't care about that. I got I am getting out of his bath. I don't care. I got I I put my body for enough pain.
Speaker 0 (01:12:16,436-01:12:21,274): Okay. This this ain't gonna do nothing. Get me out of here. Oh, wait. I'm headed absent absent buff.
Speaker 1 (01:12:21,493-01:12:25,451): I don't know, man. I'm telling you. It it it helps you recover. I know it sucks.
Speaker 0 (01:12:25,451-01:12:27,939): It sucks. I do the cry the cryotherapy as well.
Speaker 1 (01:12:27,939-01:12:28,418): That's good.
Speaker 0 (01:12:28,418-01:12:33,136): Yeah. That's good. That that there is no problem for 3 minutes. I can do that. I feel like
Speaker 1 (01:12:33,136-01:12:46,697): I've done cryotherapy, and I've done the cold plunge, and I think the cold plunge is superior. Yeah. It is. It is. It's just like when you get to that 33, 34 degree temperature and you go neck deep Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:12:46,737-01:12:47,717): Holy shit.
Speaker 0 (01:12:48,176-01:12:53,992): It makes me colder How are you just thinking about it? I'm thinking of that. I think I'm traumatized. I'm thinking of that ice buff in
Speaker 1 (01:12:53,992-01:13:09,303): my future. Is Sauna straight to ice baths straight to Sauna. It's that's the best because you get to the sauna to the point where you just can't be in there anymore. Like, 20 minutes in, I do, like, 185, like Yeah. 20 minutes in at a 185 degrees Fahrenheit.
Speaker 1 (01:13:09,322-01:13:14,399): And then right into the cold plunge, freeze my dick off for, like, 3 minutes and then back
Speaker 0 (01:13:14,399-01:13:14,599): to the
Speaker 1 (01:13:14,638-01:13:17,877): Back in. Yeah. When you get back to the song of that 185 feels like No.
Speaker 0 (01:13:17,877-01:13:18,757): It's like nothing. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:13:18,757-01:13:19,496): Like, nothing.
Speaker 0 (01:13:19,516-01:13:37,517): What's the the old school, you know, in Russia and the Soviet Union. They will do that. Yeah. I've seen that I've seen that firsthand. I actually did it in as an amateur who in Russia, fighting in the amateurs, and that took us to the mountains with the snow, and they had this little, you know, hut with a sauna in there.
Speaker 0 (01:13:37,777-01:13:46,092): So wow. This is crazy. So we'll do the sauna. And we've run straight out into the snow and see the snow and do our angels in the in the snow and back in the sauna.
Speaker 1 (01:13:46,092-01:13:52,657): Yeah. They knew what they're doing there. You know, the first time I found out about that was Do you know who Fedor or Melian Echo is?
Speaker 0 (01:13:52,657-01:13:53,177): Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:13:53,177-01:14:09,218): Yeah. So Fedor used to watch him prepare in Russia and Vader's arguably, if not the greatest heavyweight of all time, definitely in the argument of 1 of the greatest heavyweights of all time. He's probably three guys you can make that argument Yeah. On Fedor's one of them. He's might be the best.
Speaker 1 (01:14:09,438-01:14:23,619): But he would do they would call it a Banya. And in the Soviet Union in Russia, and they would they do the the hot bath, and they do the cold plunge, the hot bath. And I remember thinking about that. And, like, this guy Everything he does is old school. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:14:23,619-01:14:28,856): And, yeah, he's dominating everybody. He does kettle bells for his workouts and conditioning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:14:28,856-01:14:35,362): Yeah. Yeah. So they would they would I mean, Russia's cold. It's fuck. Look at that.
Speaker 1 (01:14:35,362-01:14:49,024): Yeah. Get in that freezing cold water. And then they would go sauna to that back and forth. But there's something about that Oh, the song is back there. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:14:49,203-01:15:00,387): There's something about that going back and forth that really just it does something to you that makes you feel fantastic after workouts. It's just I think yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:15:00,847-01:15:13,608): With with the way the body is you know, I think from going to the the the cold and then the heat, you know, it just stuff that relaxes the muscles gets the lactic acids out. Yeah. I think I need to introduce the the cold. Yeah. You're going through it.
Speaker 0 (01:15:13,608-01:15:17,167): Yeah. I know. I just I just love the the the Epsom songs that he Oh,
Speaker 1 (01:15:17,167-01:15:17,627): I love that.
Speaker 0 (01:15:17,726-01:15:25,320): Quite a lot. I sweat the weight the weight management is is is great by doing it. But, you know, if I add that in there as well,
Speaker 1 (01:15:25,360-01:15:29,018): know it's phenomenal. Have you ever done a sensory deprivation tank?
Speaker 0 (01:15:29,318-01:15:34,274): I have I actually done 2 of them before I attempted the US. Really? And it was unbelievable.
Speaker 1 (01:15:34,694-01:15:43,878): That's all epsom salts too. So it's not just good for the brain, just faint and faint and relaxed, but it's amazing for your muscles because there's so much salt in there, way more than a regular
Speaker 0 (01:15:43,878-01:15:52,343): abs and back. I think 400 kilos. I think there's a lot of salt in there. The first one I did You know, they told me that your mind will wander. Mhmm.
Speaker 0 (01:15:52,343-01:16:12,632): And, you know, I went in there and trying to relax and, you know, I could hear the music and then they turn the music off so you let your brain relax. And then by the end, I was like, I can't just switch off. I just wanna switch off. Of a sudden, the music went back on to to say that there's 10 more minutes to go and just boom. Just switched off.
Speaker 0 (01:16:12,632-01:16:19,937): And of a sudden, it's like, time. So that was the first one. I go, okay. This is great. So then the second one, you know, I really felt it.
Speaker 0 (01:16:19,937-01:16:29,112): I really switched off, you know, that the white one that Yeah. And I think envision. I was manifesting, you know, the belts winning this fight. So I've seen it. That's amazing.
Speaker 1 (01:16:29,732-01:16:36,598): Yeah. That's the the thing about it is it it takes a while to get relax. Yeah. But if you do it a bunch of times, then they become accustomed to this.
Speaker 0 (01:16:36,598-01:16:37,117): That's right.
Speaker 1 (01:16:37,117-01:16:52,888): Yeah. But as far as a guy like you trying to envision winning titles and fighting and I think it's a phenomenal tool. It's a phenomenal tool for anybody that is working on visualization because you're alone in the total Total silence, total darkness, you're floating. You don't even feel anything.
Speaker 0 (01:16:52,888-01:17:00,983): I'm very big on manifesting and visualizing it like my room in New York. It was overlooking Madison Square Garden, I could see it.
Speaker 1 (01:17:00,983-01:17:01,383): Oh, wow.
Speaker 0 (01:17:01,383-01:17:10,788): And, literally, every night I'm just there looking at that guy, that's that's where I'm doing history. That's my history right there. Yeah. I'm meant to be here. Initially before the fight, I'm there looking at it and I go, okay.
Speaker 0 (01:17:10,888-01:17:35,625): That's that's the place. But Wow. Another little trick that I do is, you know, you got my diary that I write every day. I've wrote three things that you know, what I'm doing for, what I mean to most. Obviously, every time I'm my kids, my kids, but, you know, you're you're right after your legacy, for for, you know, your your country, all the little things that first thing in the morning, you have any coffee, you write it down, you just sets me in a right in a right path.
Speaker 1 (01:17:36,385-01:17:40,182): Yeah. Have did you learn to do that? Is that something was taught
Speaker 0 (01:17:40,182-01:17:48,417): to you? I believe it was Sugar, I landed. That that was doing it as well. I saw it somewhere, and I go, you know what? This was letting into my water cooled eliminator.
Speaker 0 (01:17:48,797-01:17:54,004): I said, okay. I'm gonna try that. I'm gonna do that. Let me see if it works. And just writing it down.
Speaker 0 (01:17:54,004-01:18:05,757): Just kicks off the day in in a good place, you know, about the visualizing and manifesting and seeing it before it actually happens. From a young kid. I feel like I've always had this this 6¢, and I could just say it.
Speaker 1 (01:18:05,777-01:18:06,217): Really?
Speaker 0 (01:18:06,217-01:18:07,056): Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1 (01:18:07,056-01:18:11,773): So have you always been a kid that's been very focused on very specific goals?
Speaker 0 (01:18:12,152-01:18:30,799): I have been, yeah, always from from a young kid. I put my brain and my focus onto something I can achieve and I can do it. You know, when I when I was young, you know, with obviously, my family, there was no young kids around us. You know, I was born and then my sister came, you know, a lot many years later. Those nice cousins.
Speaker 0 (01:18:30,799-01:18:49,569): I was always hanging out with with the older, you know, crowd, and and, you know, the the the parents and and my parents' friends So I think just from that that young kid, that age, you know, you become a little bit more mature and you realize that you can visualize things and Yeah. I think something from there, you know, is transport to where I am now as well.
Speaker 1 (01:18:49,569-01:18:52,907): When did you first think that you were gonna become a boxer?
Speaker 0 (01:18:54,927-01:19:00,863): Look. I fell into boxing, but by luck. It really was. It was by luck. It wasn't because my father was a fighter.
Speaker 0 (01:19:01,762-01:19:13,556): You know, it was by luck. I was playing rugby. You know, back in Australia, you know, as a ten, eleven year old, you know, from starting at age 6. That's all I want to do in my life. I want to be a footy player, but I was overweight.
Speaker 0 (01:19:13,556-01:19:24,370): I was getting putting on a lot of weight. So in the off season, my my dad said, you know, we gotta do something here. You know, you're not gonna be able to cut it. Like, she you're not gonna make the the ice squad. I said, alright.
Speaker 0 (01:19:24,410-01:19:31,385): Because we live not not live not far from the beach. Yes. We'll do nippers. What's the nipper? So Nippers is beach running.
Speaker 0 (01:19:31,704-01:19:32,184): You run the
Speaker 1 (01:19:32,344-01:19:33,943): Why do you call it nippers? I don't know.
Speaker 0 (01:19:33,943-01:19:45,467): It's the the Aussie the Aussie fans who and people watching will be will be Sanica Nippers. Oh, yeah. Nippers. Nippers. You don't know what Nippers Nippers are.
Speaker 0 (01:19:45,467-01:19:54,491): Nippers are. No way. You're not gonna see this this big eleven year old, a beast kid riding down the beach. You know, the fast signal never had no chance. Because what about boxing?
Speaker 0 (01:19:54,491-01:20:09,072): You like the Rocky movies? See, yeah. Let's let's try it out. So to get to the gym, we went down to the the gym, the the local, you know, community PCY, so they say, Jim. Walking up to to the stairs, the smell of the the old school gym.
Speaker 0 (01:20:09,132-01:20:18,308): You can smell the blood in there. Mhmm. Most kids turn around in no way. Especially being overweight and being bullied his whole life. But I walked in there.
Speaker 0 (01:20:18,528-01:20:22,605): I thought at home, go out. This is amazing. Really? So let's let's do it. It's my desk.
Speaker 1 (01:20:22,605-01:20:23,255): Right away.
Speaker 0 (01:20:23,335-01:20:32,100): We're right away. So I put the gloves on, my dad said, hey. You're on your own. And that's the the kind of little battle was sent, and there was the tricks that he would do. So you're on your own.
Speaker 0 (01:20:32,220-01:20:37,358): I'll be back. I'll see I'll see when I pick you up. I fell in love with the sport. Wow. Wow.
Speaker 0 (01:20:37,737-01:20:51,828): Right away. Over the sun, I lost all this weight. And I went down to so from £134, I probably went down to, like, 1120, maybe a little bit less, 118. So Everything changed. You know, the bullying kinda stopped.
Speaker 0 (01:20:51,968-01:21:15,916): You know, my my my whole confidence grew. My food got better. All of a sudden, instead of coming last, you know, in in whatever we did. I was coming first, and I saw all of a sudden, you know, that passion for boxing, that real combat took over. So as I went back to the next year before rugby, you know, I was playing really good good rugby, and I got picked for a representative team, but at the same time I was boxing.
Speaker 0 (01:21:16,295-01:21:39,743): And You know, I made the state state championships to the team, and I just I I still love both, but boxing was was everything I wanted to do, and I wanna take that to the next level. So with the representative team, they they sat us down, the coaches sat us down, and, you know, they said, okay. You'd be training Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Australia, I said, okay. Monday was a Friday's when I have boxing 1.
Speaker 0 (01:21:39,743-01:21:53,804): That's not gonna work. So I sat in the car with my father on the way I am handled the the fully training gear that I'll be training gear in. Because, you know, could this something you wanna do your whole life in you shut away? You could see my my expression on my face. So, yeah, but didn't you hear?
Speaker 0 (01:21:53,824-01:21:59,021): He said, what? Didn't you ready? Because Monday, Wednesday, Friday. That's boxing. He said, yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:21:59,021-01:22:08,267): Well, you're gonna have to make a decision. Guess remember I was telling you about the crossroads. God, I know what it is now. The crossroads. So this is like 11, 12 years of age.
Speaker 0 (01:22:09,184-01:22:17,369): So you guys look. It's a weekend now. I'm gonna give you the weekend to think about it. Come Monday after I finish work. Wanna say what box what bag's gonna be.
Speaker 0 (01:22:17,369-01:22:25,433): Yeah. The boxing bag or the footy bag, and we'll go where you wanna go, where you're hiding, sir. You make the decision. So I thought about it. I said, no.
Speaker 0 (01:22:25,433-01:22:32,280): I'm gonna be a fighter, you know, and my heart was there and come Monday, boxing bag, boxing gloves, That's good.
Speaker 1 (01:22:32,659-01:22:34,878): How did your rugby coach handle that?
Speaker 0 (01:22:35,018-01:22:52,228): Look. I was upset because I saw how dedicated it was and and and what a what a good player it was, but they understood it because they knew that, you know, boxing was there, and that's how I lost all that weight and become a good good player. So they said, look. You know, whatever he wants to do, the the kid made his decision. We support him.
Speaker 0 (01:22:52,228-01:22:59,523): You know? And, obviously, they'll be looking at this now saying, well, He did. He went all the way and and and won the belts. Yeah. What what a crazy story?
Speaker 1 (01:22:59,523-01:23:03,901): That's a that is a crazy story. So how old are you when you had your first amateur fight?
Speaker 0 (01:23:04,659-01:23:06,538): Yeah. 11:12. My first time was
Speaker 1 (01:23:06,538-01:23:07,178): right around there. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:23:07,178-01:23:08,018): They're right around there. And so
Speaker 1 (01:23:08,018-01:23:08,817): they jumped right in there.
Speaker 0 (01:23:08,817-01:23:18,241): Pretty much in there. Straight away. I lost all the way, and you won't have a fight. And, again, funny story is I remember my coach sign you won't have a fight. I said, okay.
Speaker 0 (01:23:18,241-01:23:30,454): That'd be cool. I went and told my dad when he picked me up in the car, he goes, the coach wants me to have a fight. He said, fight. He goes, we didn't come here to fight. We came here to to lose weight, and and you know, get better for for rugby.
Speaker 0 (01:23:30,874-01:23:40,178): I said, well, I'm gonna do it. Because alright. I'm gonna support you then. So I remember That first four was was I fought this really tall kid. It was massive.
Speaker 0 (01:23:40,597-01:23:49,223): And it's like it's like I was doing a 100 meter 1st hour swimming race. I was just throwing punches, hey, mate. I I bloody him up. I beat him. I won the fight.
Speaker 0 (01:23:49,522-01:23:52,860): I got hooked. You know, that that real combat you you can't beat him.
Speaker 1 (01:23:53,139-01:24:03,893): Yeah. What was that like when you're I mean, you don't have a whole family that was into it. You just you're a young guy. You make this decision. Like, what did it feel like once you won that first fight?
Speaker 1 (01:24:03,893-01:24:05,213): Were you like, this is it?
Speaker 0 (01:24:05,213-01:24:20,134): I was trying to watch it. This is this is unbelievable. You know, that feeling before a fight, especially in the amateurs, you're using the same gloves, you know, that we're using the tournaments. So you're putting more and you can see the blood and you can smell it and, you know, the the the sweating and everything. You know, you got everyone.
Speaker 0 (01:24:20,473-01:24:31,218): They're ready to watch. Wow. It's pretty crazy, but, you know, my grandparents are old school too, so I'm trying to tell them that you know, I'm fighting, unboxing. They're like, no. No.
Speaker 0 (01:24:31,218-01:24:31,618): No. No.
Speaker 1 (01:24:31,618-01:24:32,358): Well well,
Speaker 0 (01:24:32,457-01:24:37,084): they can't even deal with me having an earring a little line, all the tattoos. No. No. No. No.
Speaker 0 (01:24:37,084-01:24:38,004): No. No. No. No. No.
Speaker 0 (01:24:38,004-01:24:40,682): No. Wait. Go get a job. Go work. Oh, boy.
Speaker 0 (01:24:40,682-01:24:42,822): No. No. No. I'm on a box, you know, and
Speaker 1 (01:24:42,980-01:24:44,119): Are they still around?
Speaker 0 (01:24:44,699-01:24:48,617): All of myself, my grandfather. Yeah. And and same with him. You know? God bless him now.
Speaker 0 (01:24:48,617-01:24:52,774): He he say, yeah. He's old school. Now, eventually, I
Speaker 1 (01:24:52,774-01:24:53,573): realized, though.
Speaker 0 (01:24:53,573-01:25:07,366): Eventually, he did. But even even before this flight, when we spoke to him, you know, before he passed away, leading to this fought with all the dramas that we had. He said, just just accept or whatever. Just whatever they say, just take it, get the money. You know, I have 3 families.
Speaker 0 (01:25:07,705-01:25:32,281): Still that old school mentality, make money for the family, and that's that's what they did. They came overseas in the sixties from Greece. You know, they didn't speak the language at all. You know, to give a better life for themselves and all of a sudden they they met their wives and their husbands and, you know, all of a sudden, they have a family, they raise a family, and and they move on to, you know, me being here, you know, the the the next generation, it's it really is an amazing story.
Speaker 1 (01:25:32,281-01:25:39,168): It is an amazing story. So you got a 20 o record right now. And you started your professional career in 2013.
Speaker 0 (01:25:39,588-01:25:41,427): Is that what it was? 18 years of age.
Speaker 1 (01:25:41,427-01:25:43,626): That's crazy. Right? I mean, 18
Speaker 0 (01:25:43,626-01:25:44,505): or 10 something.
Speaker 1 (01:25:44,505-01:25:45,535): Not that long ago.
Speaker 0 (01:25:46,374-01:26:07,503): You know, to think about it that, you know, a year and a half, 2 years ago, when I fought at MSG, when I beat Mickey Bay, I only got paid, like, $20. To think. And when I paid everybody else's and worked down my training expenses and had my had my kids there and my wife, you know, with me. Okay. I lived off the sponsorships, you know, the smaller amount of sponsorships.
Speaker 1 (01:26:07,722-01:26:10,161): That was your 1st real world class opponent.
Speaker 0 (01:26:10,161-01:26:22,494): Yeah. Yeah. It was. And know, when his name popped up, you know, and I said Mickey Bay, I was already number 3 in the world at this stage, but I wasn't tested yet properly on the American Senate. I jumped at Australia while so excited.
Speaker 0 (01:26:22,494-01:26:37,135): Okay. This is what I I came into the US for. This is the kind of guy, a veteran, a guy that's been there, a guy that that knows the ins and outs of boxing, the little tricks, you know, that the smooth moves, and that's what I wanted. A lot of fire rules are now too risky. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:26:37,135-01:26:47,358): Let's suck it. Let's suck up the another guy. Let's get close to the rankings. Hopefully, we'll get a shot, and we'll make some money and see how we go and put I've always been about taking the hardest road, the risk. You know?
Speaker 0 (01:26:47,358-01:26:49,617): That's that's that's what I did in that fight as well.
Speaker 1 (01:26:49,637-01:27:06,167): You certainly did, and that's it's a wake up call to people too when they they hear about that purse. Because a lot of people, they think of boxing purses, they think of the purse that Tyson Fury gets or that, you know, Floyd Mayweather get or Dante Wilder. The reality is guys coming up even when you're headlining.
Speaker 0 (01:27:06,227-01:27:06,507): Yep.
Speaker 1 (01:27:06,507-01:27:09,155): Even when you're the main event. It's not a lot of money.
Speaker 0 (01:27:09,235-01:27:17,890): No. It really isn't. You know? And if you go out to thinking that it's just about the money, you will fall over. You don't chase the money who eventually come.
Speaker 0 (01:27:18,080-01:27:37,869): Again, with this slide too, I was originally set with TRULA to get 2,100,000 US. All of a sudden, the the problems that happened and the issues, you know, it was a lot less now for for Matrim. But for me, it was never about the money and people were online and and friends were saying, you crazy, man. What are you doing? Because we kinda took a stance.
Speaker 0 (01:27:38,009-01:27:45,734): He said that, no. We wanna fight. We're sick of these these games. And, you know, the the sanctioned body went out and said that, no. That this is enough.
Speaker 0 (01:27:45,734-01:27:52,178): No more date changes. You guys are done. Yeah. You know, a lot of money to lose. It is.
Speaker 0 (01:27:52,178-01:27:54,298): But I knew my vision. I said, it doesn't matter.
Speaker 1 (01:27:54,298-01:27:55,917): What was the difference in the beta?
Speaker 0 (01:27:55,977-01:28:02,723): It was from 2.1to1.3. Wow. So a fair bit of money, but Almost a $1,000,000. Yeah. Pretty much.
Speaker 0 (01:28:02,723-01:28:04,822): Yeah. But again, it's never about that.
Speaker 1 (01:28:05,402-01:28:20,772): But look what the glory did and look where the position you're in now. Mean, now you're in a position to make a gigantic amount of money. If they can pull off that huge show in Austria, Australia. Yeah. If you could talk somebody in a going to Australia and you do a stadium, my goodness.
Speaker 0 (01:28:21,152-01:28:33,354): Unbelievable. Whoo. It's it's gonna be big. But, again, it's never been about the money. For the money sets up my family, my kids, for me, it's it's, you know, that that glory, the legacy, you know Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:28:33,414-01:28:37,952): The battles. I love the battles. Right. You know, I love that that real combat. You know, get excited.
Speaker 0 (01:28:38,411-01:28:40,671): I wanna fight. I love to fight.
Speaker 1 (01:28:41,210-01:28:51,794): When you started out your career, did you have a boxer that you emulated or that you wanted to be like or someone who you admired their career and wanted to
Speaker 0 (01:28:52,233-01:28:59,370): I have similar style. You know, reverted Durant. Wow. And I'll and I'll say privileged to to Face on with him a couple days ago. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:28:59,900-01:29:02,359): Mauriccia Solomon from WBC president.
Speaker 1 (01:29:02,379-01:29:04,737): Oh, man. I met him in Madison Square Garden once.

Speaker 1 (01:29:16,730-01:29:17,529): This is a lightweight.
Speaker 0 (01:29:17,529-01:29:29,123): It's a lightweight. And, you know, that WBC built, you know, to see him on there. And, obviously, I'm on there, and he got sloyd on there that that that great lightweight Yeah. You know, when Marissa said, okay. I wanna FaceTime him.
Speaker 0 (01:29:29,223-01:29:30,102): I was, like, real
Speaker 1 (01:29:30,102-01:29:30,822): nervous. I can't
Speaker 0 (01:29:31,142-01:29:40,367): it's not random. You know? So, you know, I spoke to him. He was is so, yeah, so happy to to to chat and, you know, congratulated me, which which is amazing. You know?
Speaker 1 (01:29:40,367-01:29:41,147): That's fantastic.
Speaker 0 (01:29:41,207-01:30:02,263): He's unbelievable. And I had my Durant moment in that forest world because around the world when we both, you know, looked at each other, and he didn't wanna accept it like this. And I just I was waiting for some kind of acceptance and he didn't want it. So I gave him that that shove that push like, hey. And then I'm gonna celebrate But the Randy, we should go right up in the first one.
Speaker 1 (01:30:02,263-01:30:04,702): Yeah. Well, the Randy I think he called him a whore.
Speaker 0 (01:30:04,702-01:30:07,121): Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the rant for you. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:30:07,280-01:30:18,683): It's been crazy. It really has been, you know, I've I've had, obviously, Durant. I've I've faced him with Canela. You know, he he showed his he showed his you know, he his love and support and, you know, what what I what I didn't afford.
Speaker 1 (01:30:18,683-01:30:19,403): That's beautiful.
Speaker 0 (01:30:19,403-01:30:25,060): You know, I know Manny Pacquiao, I'll be faced on with with him as well. That's awesome. I'm sitting here with you. It's it's it's been crazy.
Speaker 1 (01:30:25,390-01:30:31,187): Canelo is in a crazy position, man. He's gonna move up to cruiserweight for his next fight.
Speaker 0 (01:30:31,187-01:30:31,687): Unbelievable.
Speaker 1 (01:30:31,987-01:30:32,966): Isn't that wild?
Speaker 0 (01:30:33,026-01:30:37,193): He just loves the the challenge challenges. Yeah. I think that's what gets him up.
Speaker 1 (01:30:37,193-01:30:47,498): It must. I mean, he's truly one of the all time greats already. But the fact that he went up to light heavyweight knocked out Kovalev, and now he wants to go all the way up to cruiserweight. 198.
Speaker 0 (01:30:48,238-01:30:53,044): He's gonna foot that Macaboo. Yeah. And that's no joking. He's a bit
Speaker 1 (01:30:53,044-01:30:53,944): in big, fella.
Speaker 0 (01:30:53,964-01:30:58,162): Big, strong. Yeah. I've got a lot of guys, so this is a risk, but
Speaker 1 (01:30:58,162-01:30:58,921): it's a big risk.
Speaker 0 (01:30:58,921-01:31:02,119): He loves it. Without risk, You know, that that is not reward.
Speaker 1 (01:31:02,179-01:31:13,352): Well, I think he really truly has his his mind set on being the greatest Mexican champion of all time. And maybe even great the greatest boxer of all time. And I think he can do it. I think he's in that running.
Speaker 0 (01:31:13,352-01:31:13,632): Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:31:13,632-01:31:38,498): When you see, like, the Danny Jacobs fight, and you see his head movement Yeah. And you realize, like, how much he's taken from the one loss that he had, the Floyd, where he I mean, that was a fight where he realized, like, man, There's levels to this shit, and there's some guys you just can't hit. And what how amazing was that transformation from him before that to afterwards? Because now his head movement A little. His defense is sensational,
Speaker 0 (01:31:38,958-01:31:41,737): and he's not a big, big guy. No. He's more.
Speaker 1 (01:31:41,996-01:31:46,104): Potanzis. Probably 58. Yeah. 58. And now it's gonna go up to 190.
Speaker 1 (01:31:46,363-01:31:47,863): What it was cruiserweight 95.
Speaker 0 (01:31:47,962-01:31:48,922): I think so. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:31:48,922-01:31:54,848): That's wild, man. Because you're talking about a guy who's probably 210 and cut him down to 95.
Speaker 0 (01:31:54,848-01:31:57,967): I think he'd say that he was not gonna come in, you know, heavy at all.
Speaker 1 (01:31:57,967-01:31:58,995): Nobody's opponent will.
Speaker 0 (01:31:59,075-01:31:59,755): That's right. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:31:59,755-01:32:00,074): So And
Speaker 0 (01:32:00,074-01:32:09,489): he said he's gonna try stay around that that that natural, you know, weight that he's at because he doesn't wanna put on anymore because it probably affect his speed and Yes. Movements.
Speaker 1 (01:32:09,489-01:32:17,905): Well, all you have to do is be over 175. Right? I mean Right. That's cruiser weight is basically what there's nothing between 75 and cruiser. Right?
Speaker 1 (01:32:18,105-01:32:20,244): So one of the few weight classes in boxing,
Speaker 0 (01:32:20,263-01:32:21,143): I don't think so. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:32:21,143-01:32:24,042): Yeah. It's a weird it's a weird jump. Right? In boxing,
Speaker 0 (01:32:24,062-01:32:33,647): and you know what? I'm trying to think how many divisions it is I don't know if he's trying to get close to to the great many pukyo. I don't think he he can I don't think he can? Yeah. That's fine.
Speaker 0 (01:32:33,687-01:32:35,575): To heavyweight. Heavy or super heavy, sir.
Speaker 1 (01:32:35,615-01:32:46,478): Alright. Because correct me if I'm wrong, but boxing goes middleweight 160 Super main. Middle super 68. Light heavyweight 75, but then there's a giant jump to cruiserweight.
Speaker 0 (01:32:46,478-01:32:54,544): Cruiserweight. Actually, they've just introduced another white class, the Bridgerweight. Oh. So there's Richard, where's another way?
Speaker 1 (01:32:54,643-01:32:55,323): Where is that?
Speaker 0 (01:32:55,323-01:32:56,463): So I can hear you.
Speaker 1 (01:32:56,562-01:32:57,922): Between cruiser and heavy?
Speaker 0 (01:32:57,922-01:33:00,130): Yes. I think so. Oh. Yeah. But You're right.
Speaker 1 (01:33:00,229-01:33:09,184): But between light heavy and cruisers £20. Mhmm. That's a big gap of boxing. The fact that he's gonna make that leap So And the fact that he started off at 154. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:33:09,184-01:33:11,163): It's crazy. And he fought Floyd at 52.
Speaker 0 (01:33:11,223-01:33:11,923): It's crazy.
Speaker 1 (01:33:11,942-01:33:13,182): Nuts. Nuts.
Speaker 0 (01:33:13,182-01:33:28,452): And it shows it shows the grandfather he is that the the a risk he's willing to take, and you gotta applaud that. Even after a loss against the lord, he's come back and he's beat all these guys. You know, incredible. No. It's truly a a great isolator and a great fighter.
Speaker 1 (01:33:28,452-01:33:30,851): We if he retired tomorrow, he's one of the all time.
Speaker 0 (01:33:30,851-01:33:33,979): Yes. Yeah. He's in the hall of fame. Will you, Tom Greitz?
Speaker 1 (01:33:33,979-01:33:39,936): Without doubt. Without doubt. And if you, you know, you watch his knockout of Caleb plans
Speaker 0 (01:33:39,976-01:33:40,245): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:33:40,405-01:33:44,363): Like, the the so that was the one he had to earn. Yeah. He didn't Yeah. Kayla earned that 1.
Speaker 0 (01:33:44,363-01:34:04,642): I met Caleb 2 nights ago. He was at the hotel in in LA, and really nice guy, Greg Gordon. You know, he he seemed disappointed because he goes, I was trying to do what what you just done in in these builds. And said, man, you get so much harder, and you and you gain so much respect Yeah. Because, you know, a lot of people weren't giving him that chance and to do what he did.
Speaker 0 (01:34:04,642-01:34:10,009): You know, he didn't win the fight, but, you know, you you got that respect. You went know, so many rounds.
Speaker 1 (01:34:10,029-01:34:10,709): He looked at me.
Speaker 0 (01:34:10,709-01:34:15,366): He looked very good at your box noise, and he said he had 21 votes, 22 votes.
Speaker 1 (01:34:15,466-01:34:24,531): It was a learning experience for sure. A learning experience for sure. But you look at Canelo's power is wild. What he did to Saunders? That was wild.
Speaker 0 (01:34:24,531-01:34:25,571): Actually, that that was
Speaker 1 (01:34:25,571-01:34:26,571): actually his face.
Speaker 0 (01:34:26,571-01:34:28,040): You think from from one shot,
Speaker 1 (01:34:28,120-01:34:33,037): one shot. Yeah. Did you ever look at the the diagram of all the repair they had to do to his face? I did
Speaker 0 (01:34:33,037-01:34:35,196): see me. I did see it. Yeah. Yeah. It's brutal.
Speaker 0 (01:34:35,196-01:34:35,895): Crazy. Okay.
Speaker 1 (01:34:35,975-01:34:42,910): Everywhere. Eye socket, all the orbital boneless shattered around the eye socket, the cheek, the jaw
Speaker 0 (01:34:42,990-01:34:46,029): think from just one punch, one one devastating shot like that.
Speaker 1 (01:34:46,029-01:34:47,548): That one of the soccer game punch.
Speaker 0 (01:34:47,548-01:34:51,106): And and and, again, Billy Joe was boxing nice. Yeah. It was it was it was
Speaker 1 (01:34:51,106-01:34:51,745): looked very good.
Speaker 0 (01:34:51,745-01:34:59,591): But you know, can they, like, feel like, even in the Caleb Plan Flight fight, you know, he's just doing his thing. Mhmm. He's waiting for the moment. He's so composed. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:34:59,591-01:35:03,598): You know, a lot of guys try to rush. A lot of boys that they forget about that composure
Speaker 1 (01:35:03,878-01:35:04,198): Right.
Speaker 0 (01:35:04,238-01:35:10,655): In the fight game. Switching boxing. You got 12 rounds. Yeah. You got a lot of time, 36 minutes.
Speaker 0 (01:35:11,074-01:35:17,991): Yeah. In in their ropes. A lot of time to to, you know, dissect your opponent and and break them down. Yeah. Totally does.
Speaker 0 (01:35:17,991-01:35:19,220): Does it does it say well?
Speaker 1 (01:35:19,380-01:35:39,218): He does it so well, and he has that patience and confidence of a multi division world champion whose face the best of the best so that when he gets into those championship rounds, gets into those later rounds. He knows that he's he's managed his energy so perfectly. The Kovalov fight's a good example of that. Right? Because Kovalov looked pretty good.
Speaker 1 (01:35:39,218-01:35:40,258): Early on the fight.
Speaker 0 (01:35:40,377-01:35:40,937): Very nice.
Speaker 1 (01:35:40,937-01:35:49,233): But to see him knock out Kovalov and I think this is just fucking I know Kovalov is not the same Covalib has fought Andre Ward the first time. But if you see
Speaker 0 (01:35:49,713-01:35:56,769): Still there? Yeah. That was a brutal shot over the plane, and Covalib was all over the shop. And while putting down him. He's a big boy.
Speaker 1 (01:35:56,769-01:35:59,668): I know he cracking with one left fucking Adam fucked.
Speaker 0 (01:35:59,807-01:36:14,098): Oh, blurb. It's crazy. Truly, truly, an all time grade and and a guy that we're we're getting to witness and have the pleasure to witness right now. Yeah. So to be able to FaceTime with him and and you know, just hear his advice, you know, about keeping that dedication.
Speaker 0 (01:36:14,278-01:36:19,834): Don't lose sort of of what you're doing and, you know, continue you know, raining for a long time was was amazing. And
Speaker 1 (01:36:19,953-01:36:20,493): That is amazing.
Speaker 0 (01:36:20,633-01:36:29,668): I'm sure Lipus didn't like seeing that when I think posted because I know he was only a few weeks ago, up there with all his belts. Yeah. Trying to take the long word of of Canela. At least
Speaker 1 (01:36:29,788-01:36:33,687): Well, Lopez is a young guy. What is he? 24? 24.
Speaker 0 (01:36:33,746-01:36:33,946): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:36:33,946-01:36:43,899): Yeah. He's gonna develop character from this. Not that he doesn't already have character, but he's gonna develop more character from this. And I think this loss will make him a better fighter.
Speaker 0 (01:36:43,899-01:36:53,293): A 100%. And that's what I told him too. You know, when when that fall was done and, you know, and you had won the fought said, you bounce back. You bounce back, you know, respect. You know?
Speaker 0 (01:36:53,293-01:37:00,658): But he's young. He's gonna learn, and, you know, I can't sit here and lock the guy. I I I bled with a guy. I swear to with a guy. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:37:00,658-01:37:03,937): Now we gave, you know, that that the world an unbelievable fight.
Speaker 1 (01:37:03,937-01:37:12,772): Well, it's the beautiful thing about what you did is that he is a great fighter. Yeah. And because he's a great fighter, it made your victory so amazing.
Speaker 0 (01:37:12,772-01:37:13,011): Yep.
Speaker 1 (01:37:13,011-01:37:26,992): If he wasn't a great fighter, It's it's not gonna be that impressive. It was the fact that you were facing a guy who just beat Lumichanko, who is just a world class fight there were many people thought was the scariest guy in that division, and and you came out on top.
Speaker 0 (01:37:27,132-01:37:45,462): Look, straight after my my go to Limoneira in London when I'm a bit late soapy. You know, and another former champion. A guy has been around a long time. He's straddle our court him out. And like you said, this guy was was posters that the scariest going to division, the guy that no one wants to fight, unbelievable power, unbelievable boxing hat at all.
Speaker 0 (01:37:45,462-01:38:01,981): And he does. He does have great attributes, but I knew I saw something. And again, I go back to that that 6¢ back in 2019. He was at a flight in Pachanga in in Los in California. And I was there as well.
Speaker 0 (01:38:01,981-01:38:15,283): I've got flown out to to better war championship flight, and we met. And the media goes to take a photo together. I knew inside me, I'm gonna fight this guy somewhere. So when they tweeted the photo out, I read Twitter about future megaphite. Wow.
Speaker 0 (01:38:15,283-01:38:26,687): Yeah. And I knew it. Like, I'm gonna fight this guy. Even before that when I first saw him on the scene when he came out, he had to the the stylish, you know, flight gear and making a lot of noise. He was doing the the Fortnite kind of, you know, celebrations.
Speaker 0 (01:38:27,666-01:38:34,522): God, this is feeling that I'm gonna fight him. I know I'm gonna fight him. You know? So I have that yeah. That that that feeling.
Speaker 0 (01:38:34,522-01:38:36,699): I I get that sense Do you think he's gonna
Speaker 1 (01:38:36,699-01:38:37,559): be on a rematch?
Speaker 0 (01:38:38,259-01:38:45,894): I asked him. Shut up to the fight. I said, come to an Australia, 80,000, and he nothing to do with it, and I'm hearing they want nothing to do with it. So
Speaker 1 (01:38:46,093-01:38:46,993): Why is that?
Speaker 0 (01:38:47,733-01:38:49,132): Took a lot of shots in that fight.
Speaker 1 (01:38:49,132-01:38:50,012): You think that's sort of
Speaker 0 (01:38:50,012-01:38:55,969): the field at first hand. So Yeah. I think they're gonna move up now. I think he needs a long rest. I think he needs some time.
Speaker 1 (01:38:56,188-01:39:12,739): No. But think about it is, I know he's big. I know he's big for 140 or 135, and that you know, 140 is probably better for him, but he he's not the most shredded guy. Like, when you look at him, he's got a lot of power. And he care and You gotta wonder how much of that is because he put a lot of weight on Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:39:12,839-01:39:27,970): After the weigh ins. But, you know, he has made 135 successfully in the past. I don't know what his diet and regimen and training routine is like, but it seems like if you wanna chase the big money I mean, it was such a close fight.
Speaker 0 (01:39:27,970-01:39:28,310): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:39:28,350-01:39:43,949): If you wanted to chase the big model, then I would imagine that they would take take a brack, take a break, take a breath, regroup, and look at all the options on the table, the rematches where the monies are. Mhmm. That's where the monies are. Yeah. That's where the legacy too.
Speaker 0 (01:39:43,949-01:39:50,467): And and I'm open. I'm open to everything for me or my fighter. Of course. I'd love to to to have another battle with him. So Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:39:50,586-01:40:00,189): Really, it's it's it's it's up to him now as well because I heard some stuff that, you know, he, you know, doesn't wanna box anymore at one point. So for me, he'll he'll be
Speaker 1 (01:40:00,189-01:40:01,009): hearing 24.
Speaker 0 (01:40:01,149-01:40:16,281): He'll be hearing he'll be hearing this, you know, talented kid. You know, you got the world of your feet. One loss doesn't define you. You come back, we do it again, you move up, you know, you fought someone else at 135, you bounce back up, whatever you do. You know, you don't further tailwind.
Speaker 0 (01:40:16,350-01:40:18,669): You know, it's it's too young, but you'll be back.
Speaker 1 (01:40:18,669-01:40:20,708): Did you really you heard that from a credible source?
Speaker 0 (01:40:20,708-01:40:22,467): Yeah. Yeah. I did hear it. Yeah. Really?
Speaker 0 (01:40:22,467-01:40:24,166): Yeah. I did hear it. Interesting.
Speaker 1 (01:40:25,084-01:40:27,883): Man, this is such a great time for boxing.
Speaker 0 (01:40:27,883-01:40:29,922): It is. Especially at 134 too. I
Speaker 1 (01:40:29,922-01:40:33,260): really need all the weight classes. I mean, look at Terrence Crawford.
Speaker 0 (01:40:33,380-01:40:33,579): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:40:33,579-01:40:36,138): You know, I'm in that Sean Potterfield. Holy shit.
Speaker 0 (01:40:36,138-01:40:40,336): I believe I'm not. Yeah. Both guys have been Shawn Shawn. Look. He ran abroad.
Speaker 0 (01:40:40,336-01:40:44,624): He looked great. He boxed well. He had a great game planning. Crawl footage adapts. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:40:44,624-01:40:45,823): You talk about adapting in
Speaker 1 (01:40:45,823-01:40:47,143): a fight. God. He's the boss.
Speaker 0 (01:40:47,143-01:40:49,981): He that guy's, you know, that's adapting right there.
Speaker 1 (01:40:49,981-01:40:53,549): Well, he is the best stance switcher
Speaker 0 (01:40:53,669-01:40:53,829): Yes.
Speaker 1 (01:40:53,989-01:40:54,948): Since Marvin Haggle.
Speaker 0 (01:40:54,948-01:40:55,448): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:40:55,588-01:40:56,507): I mean, he really is.
Speaker 0 (01:40:56,507-01:40:59,186): Yeah. Who hits you from from whatever side? He can knock you out without
Speaker 1 (01:40:59,186-01:41:02,184): your hand and It's such an advantage too.
Speaker 0 (01:41:02,184-01:41:02,663): Right. So I
Speaker 1 (01:41:02,663-01:41:16,057): have that advantage to be able to fight softball or orthodox with equal fluidity because he's so smooth, and he finds openings. And when he switches up on guys, you could see them make they have to calculate, and now put it into the, like, okay, Salpa. Okay, Arthur.
Speaker 0 (01:41:16,057-01:41:28,388): Well, he's never given the opponent a chance to to rate him. Right. Now, once you can read a fighter, see, Lopez owes already many many months before. You know, a new shadow worker. I see what he does.
Speaker 0 (01:41:28,388-01:41:37,063): I see the mistakes. You know, I could read it. Now, Crawford, he's a guy that, you know, hit you from here, then he switched and he's in, he's out. Yeah. You can't read a gauntlet of that.
Speaker 1 (01:41:37,063-01:41:37,383): It's very
Speaker 0 (01:41:37,383-01:41:47,517): hard to read. You know? And, obviously, you know, me saying that I can't read him, you know, he's he's big. So it means I'm not gonna void him because he's he's too big for me anyway. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:41:47,517-01:42:07,447): But he's he's a he's a good fighter, man. He's a mate. You know, for me, I'm I'm even going to the fight on the weekend, the Haynie JJDS flight, going to the Ajavante Davis flight with ESAC Cruise. As a flight fan, not only as a guy that I was skating to see, okay, who who might be the next guy. Just as a flight fan, see, and the flight's been there.
Speaker 0 (01:42:07,605-01:42:09,484): You know, I I look for that. I love it.
Speaker 1 (01:42:09,484-01:42:12,442): That's beautiful. I'm I was very impressed with cruise as well.
Speaker 0 (01:42:12,442-01:42:13,042): He fought Will.
Speaker 1 (01:42:13,042-01:42:14,121): He fought Will.
Speaker 0 (01:42:14,121-01:42:14,890): And he's tiny,
Speaker 1 (01:42:14,930-01:42:19,288): He just comes in. But that shell that he finds out they're hard to pick it apart and
Speaker 0 (01:42:19,288-01:42:25,485): make sure when you got him coming full of that in his phone. Danger shots. Yep. And he exhorted me. He didn't get the wind, but You know?
Speaker 1 (01:42:25,485-01:42:32,681): Well, both him and but there means so many good fights. Yeah. There's I mean, God, this is like it's such an incredible old time for boxing.
Speaker 0 (01:42:32,681-01:42:33,001): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:42:33,001-01:42:39,347): But then basically, every division, you know, twice. Yeah. From the top down, from heavyweight down.
Speaker 0 (01:42:39,347-01:42:50,940): It's a good time. Boxing is in a really good state. Yeah. A really good position, and we are starting to say more and more, you know, the the the best effort and the best. You know, I think everyone is trying to become the undisputed champions in their divisions.
Speaker 0 (01:42:50,940-01:43:01,125): And and I walk better away because then it solidifies. There's a one champion. There's a one champion. There won't be all these different chambers all over the shop. It gives more credibility to boxing as well.
Speaker 1 (01:43:01,165-01:43:06,962): No. I think so for sure. And I think that, you know, that old expression as the heavyweight goes, so those boxer
Speaker 0 (01:43:07,042-01:43:07,322): Yep.
Speaker 1 (01:43:07,362-01:43:16,196): Like and that's perfect this is a perfect example. Because right now, the heavyweight division's on fire. Yep. Because there's so much exciting activity in the heavyweight division. You know?
Speaker 1 (01:43:16,196-01:43:23,403): I mean, they're gonna do that who's sick versus Joshua rematch, which was what a fight that was. Uh-huh.
Speaker 0 (01:43:23,702-01:43:26,449): You know, I said that Yushik is an unbelievable boxer.
Speaker 1 (01:43:26,449-01:43:27,569): Oh my god. It's so good.
Speaker 0 (01:43:27,569-01:43:42,051): I've got the opportunity to fight on his the domain when I won my war toilet liner. It just He's not a big, big guy. No. He's not massive, but the way he boxes the full work that he has, you know, that that that cellphone positions Mhmm. Unbelievable.
Speaker 0 (01:43:42,430-01:43:50,925): You know? And Look, I love Joshua too. Great for her. You know, he's gonna have to really come with something special, you know, to to win this rematch and against him. Well, it's against him.
Speaker 0 (01:43:50,965-01:43:54,483): What's the schedule? I think this is in March. I think I'm here in March. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:43:54,483-01:44:02,699): Do you think when when a guy gets so thoroughly outboxed like that and almost put away in the 12th, do you think that's quick to come back from a fight like that.
Speaker 0 (01:44:03,358-01:44:11,243): It is. But, again, it shows that the testament that that Joshua has Yes. And let's say, you know what? Like, the Rees fight Yeah. Right back in the straight back on the horse.
Speaker 1 (01:44:11,243-01:44:13,242): Yeah. But Ruiz didn't get back on the horse.
Speaker 0 (01:44:13,242-01:44:14,562): That's the that's the rest of the year.
Speaker 1 (01:44:14,562-01:44:15,781): Ruiz got in the kitchen.
Speaker 0 (01:44:16,570-01:44:18,848): You enjoyed it too much. She's looking good now, but Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:44:18,968-01:44:30,383): So it's great now. But then again, right, that's a wake up call. Right? And those wake up calls for a guy like him are so important. And now See if you can find a a recent picture of Andy Ruiz, because he looks fucking incredible.
Speaker 0 (01:44:30,383-01:44:33,101): Well, he's with the Canela team. Yeah. Eddie Ruiz.
Speaker 1 (01:44:33,101-01:44:34,559): There's there's a I love that.
Speaker 0 (01:44:34,559-01:44:36,558): Got him going going the way he's meant to be.
Speaker 1 (01:44:36,558-01:44:43,434): But I'll tell you why. I didn't you got in trouble with Chris Ariola because he did the same thing with Ariola that that Lopez tried to do with you.
Speaker 0 (01:44:43,434-01:44:43,634): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:44:43,634-01:44:45,893): He tried to just come out of him. Guns blazing.
Speaker 0 (01:44:45,913-01:44:52,189): And and a realtor, you know, he's a hard nosed veteran of God that's been there, and he's taken shots and you'll give them back.
Speaker 1 (01:44:52,329-01:44:53,448): Ariel is a war.
Speaker 0 (01:44:53,448-01:44:54,368): Yeah. Good fight.
Speaker 1 (01:44:54,368-01:45:04,741): Yeah. Great fight. And such a I mean, you wanna talk about a great Mexican standoff between those 2 guys. My god. That was classic Mexican boxing match.
Speaker 0 (01:45:04,741-01:45:04,941): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:45:04,941-01:45:14,614): You know what I mean? And that's what you know, like, if there is one nationality that's, like, synonymous with blood and guts amazing fights, it's me.
Speaker 0 (01:45:14,614-01:45:16,733): It's in Mexico. They they love it. They love it.
Speaker 1 (01:45:16,733-01:45:17,553): Oh my god.
Speaker 0 (01:45:17,573-01:45:28,108): You should've seen, like, in LA, you know, that will go crazy in Vegas. They keep coming up. They love the the blood and the guts and Yeah. You know, the back and forth exchanges Yeah. The lockdowns.
Speaker 0 (01:45:28,127-01:45:42,388): They love it, and they they idolize it. You know? They do. I wish I wish more, you know, nationalities were were like that, you know, in the 4th game, but that's one one country that I really love their their 4th game and you know, they got some tremendous, you know, champions.
Speaker 1 (01:45:42,388-01:46:04,287): Oh, so many champions. I mean, like, arguably, when the grace of all time, Olio says Ojavez. And then I think now with Canelo, moving into the position as first of all, he's, like, the number one pay per view draw right now or right up there with Tyson Fury. And arguably, not just the best that's active right now, pound for pound. But, like, one of the best of all time.
Speaker 0 (01:46:04,287-01:46:05,755): He is. Yeah. It really is.
Speaker 1 (01:46:05,835-01:46:10,153): It's Here we go. Look how good he lives. Wow. Look at him on the rise. Look at him.
Speaker 0 (01:46:10,153-01:46:13,631): Yeah. That was the that was the I believe that was the Joshua rematch.
Speaker 1 (01:46:13,631-01:46:19,628): Was it the rematch? I think. Yeah. You got a little heavy. It looks very good.
Speaker 1 (01:46:20,847-01:46:30,602): But, you know, like, the amount of work that it takes to get down to that. If he had done that for that Joshua rematch, he came in looking like that. Who fuck knows what would've happened?
Speaker 0 (01:46:30,822-01:46:33,710): And and psychologically too, if he came in, look like that.
Speaker 1 (01:46:33,710-01:46:34,149): Oh my god.
Speaker 0 (01:46:34,149-01:46:40,986): Joshua, we're like, okay. This guy is serious. Right. When you see him coming in like the way he did Yeah. Joshua reading that, alright.
Speaker 0 (01:46:40,986-01:46:44,034): This guy's not not taking serious. He's enjoyed it too much.
Speaker 1 (01:46:44,254-01:46:49,580): Well, there's some guys who kinda like being fat and knocking out muscular guys. You know?
Speaker 0 (01:46:49,580-01:46:54,278): Perfect example. But it being back in the but it being back in the day, you still see stuff pop up everywhere.
Speaker 1 (01:46:54,777-01:46:59,193): Yeah. Oh, people love fat people loved it with butter being 1. Like, yes. 1 for us.
Speaker 0 (01:46:59,193-01:47:01,632): I love for us. Nice.
Speaker 1 (01:47:01,632-01:47:04,870): I mean, look, Tyson Fury is not the leanest guy in the world either.
Speaker 0 (01:47:04,870-01:47:06,409): Yeah. But but the conditioning he has.
Speaker 1 (01:47:06,409-01:47:06,789): He just
Speaker 0 (01:47:07,009-01:47:14,434): his his conditioning is elite. You know, to be knocked down because the entree come up in that 3rd fight. Yeah. You know, it was a great fight.
Speaker 1 (01:47:14,434-01:47:17,673): Not only to be knocked down, but to be knocked down the way he was knocked down
Speaker 0 (01:47:17,752-01:47:17,892): Yep.
Speaker 1 (01:47:18,032-01:47:22,189): Where he got hit in the head and you see the the ripples go down his
Speaker 0 (01:47:22,189-01:47:23,009): whole body
Speaker 1 (01:47:23,348-01:47:28,805): because it was such a tremendous shot. Has it ever been a guy who punches harder than Deonte Wilder?
Speaker 0 (01:47:28,845-01:47:30,044): Don't think so. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:47:30,044-01:47:31,384): It's wild. Right?
Speaker 0 (01:47:31,444-01:47:39,300): I I think the the power he possesses, that one punch power, you know, and he came out boxing nice too. Yeah. Yeah. We look good. It's okay.
Speaker 0 (01:47:39,599-01:47:50,722): But, Shrader, how quick is he gonna go back to what he knows best when he does get tagged? That's what he did. Devastate cow and, you know, why he gave it they both gave it tremendous fight. You know, I was on
Speaker 1 (01:47:50,722-01:47:51,402): the watch almost
Speaker 0 (01:47:51,402-01:47:52,161): hit him. He did.
Speaker 1 (01:47:52,161-01:47:53,561): He almost hit him, which is crazy.
Speaker 0 (01:47:53,561-01:48:02,297): You know, when he put when he put fury down, So and you very kind of look to his corner, like, I was like, kind of said, no. I'm I'm in trouble. Yeah. Yeah. And he just rose.
Speaker 0 (01:48:02,297-01:48:08,183): You know, in that first fight, the way Roselows. Like, the undertaker first on the WWE. It's unbelievable.
Speaker 1 (01:48:09,242-01:48:18,706): Yeah. And then, you know, the 2nd fight, it got dropped twice. Yeah. Just and still managed to pull it out and then stop Deonte. And the the the chaos, when he did stop, I'm like, holy
Speaker 0 (01:48:18,706-01:48:19,785): shit. Brutal.
Speaker 1 (01:48:19,885-01:48:23,603): Brutal. They're talking about matching him up with Ruiz. Deonta and Ruiz.
Speaker 0 (01:48:23,603-01:48:24,322): Abiqua Fuad.
Speaker 1 (01:48:24,322-01:48:24,882): That's a great
Speaker 0 (01:48:24,882-01:48:32,857): Fuad. I love Steve Gong. Yeah. Go go either way, but I think Deontay's just got that pop. I just don't know how much has been taken out of him.
Speaker 0 (01:48:32,877-01:48:52,245): You know, when when you go through their walls and and their battles Mhmm. Especially coming from from from them losses to now, you lose yourself a lot. You know, they say inside their ropes, you know, a fighter loses him a bit of himself every time he goes in there Yeah. Especially when you're in the hard fight. So it just depends how much is is left in the tank for him.
Speaker 1 (01:48:52,685-01:49:02,180): Yeah. And you think about the majority of his career. It's just him knocking everybody out. Yep. And so psychologically, there's a hurdle to cross 2 because now it's two down.
Speaker 1 (01:49:02,640-01:49:08,917): And one fight in between, right, where he knocked out Louis
Speaker 0 (01:49:09,516-01:49:15,863): Ortiz. Yeah. Ortiz. Yeah. He went from the first fight, which as a draw, Nokti Ortiz, and they went digitally back to back.
Speaker 1 (01:49:15,863-01:49:19,261): Yeah. So but these two losses back to back like that.
Speaker 0 (01:49:19,261-01:49:19,761): Alright.
Speaker 1 (01:49:19,810-01:49:22,229): They're hard to dig and they were also both stoppages
Speaker 0 (01:49:22,368-01:49:22,608): Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:49:22,848-01:49:23,568): Which is hard
Speaker 0 (01:49:23,568-01:49:24,687): to deal with the comeback boy.
Speaker 1 (01:49:24,687-01:49:36,350): But and then, like, the first one, the first stoppage loss, it was all those crazy excuses too. Like, they thought egg waits and the gloves are on long. And his weight too was too heavy, and somebody poisoned them. It's like,
Speaker 0 (01:49:36,510-01:49:38,249): Reminds me of of tape wipers.
Speaker 1 (01:49:39,268-01:49:40,228): Not quite as bad.
Speaker 0 (01:49:40,228-01:49:45,784): Not as bad. No. They really yeah. He really went with everything that he could fine. Everything.
Speaker 0 (01:49:46,004-01:49:48,563): Poison yeah. The the poison from his trainer
Speaker 1 (01:49:48,723-01:49:48,963): Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:49:49,003-01:50:00,835): Which is a guy that's been with him, you know, for for his whole life. You know, the the the suit that he came out with. Yeah. You know, I just don't understand what people just you know, he'd take a look at a man. Is what it is.
Speaker 0 (01:50:00,835-01:50:05,192): Even if you do have something wrong with your own injury, you know, you make yourself look worse.
Speaker 1 (01:50:05,192-01:50:11,708): I think when a fighter is as great as he is, it's hard to have someone around him that can tell him
Speaker 0 (01:50:11,988-01:50:12,108): Yes.
Speaker 1 (01:50:12,228-01:50:17,286): Something and have him listen. Someone who's really got his interest for it. Hey, man. Don't say shit.
Speaker 0 (01:50:17,345-01:50:29,418): You would have a lot of look at me. Yes, man. Around a lot of them. And that's the most important thing for me right now is to continue keeping my my strong core people got good people around me. You know, I've got my kids.
Speaker 0 (01:50:29,418-01:50:47,358): I'm a family man away from everything. That's the most important thing in my life. So you know, there is you don't wanna get distracted in the bright lights. You don't wanna be out there doing stupid things. So I think by having my kids there, you know, the that keeps me in a position where, you know, you keep your feet on the ground, you keep looking for for more greatness.
Speaker 0 (01:50:47,497-01:50:50,336): Why canola? You know? Yeah. So much success. So much money.
Speaker 0 (01:50:50,336-01:50:54,234): Yeah. So many championship belts. Still doesn't Yeah. A girl as well. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:50:54,234-01:50:54,993): Floyd is Floyd
Speaker 1 (01:50:54,993-01:50:55,793): when he's at his time.
Speaker 0 (01:50:55,793-01:50:58,711): Floyd's top of his game. Yeah. So much so much money coming
Speaker 1 (01:50:58,711-01:50:59,451): in. Care.
Speaker 0 (01:50:59,511-01:51:02,539): Still grinds like he's got nothing. And that's a musty on a thing.
Speaker 1 (01:51:02,539-01:51:16,542): That that really is the most important thing. You know, how do you I mean, there is a time when a fighter becomes very famous wear the hanger ons and the the people that are parasites will try to come and hang out with you. How do you avoid that shit?
Speaker 0 (01:51:16,921-01:51:42,728): I got a good paper, Rami, my father. You know, he's he's he's a solid guy. So, you know, he can see him coming straight away, fighting him, but I'm very sharp as well. You know, I can see someone that's trying to take advantage you know, for for their for their gain. So if these guys haven't been there from the start through through the trenches, the hard work that we've had to go through, because I've really had to earn every every spot in any position I'm in right now.
Speaker 0 (01:51:42,867-01:51:48,434): You know, they're not there for the right reason. So if I don't see him firsthand, my father will So
Speaker 1 (01:51:48,994-01:51:50,793): Well, that's beautiful that you have that.
Speaker 0 (01:51:50,793-01:51:51,173): That's Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:51:51,313-01:52:04,476): That that helps tremendously. Now, do you get approached by a lot of sponsors and a lot of companies that want you to represent them. And if you do, like, how do you manage your time when it comes to that stuff?
Speaker 0 (01:52:04,476-01:52:16,169): Because Yeah. Look. There's a lot more now coming. But, you know, my my manager Peter Khan, you know, he's very sharp with with that as well. And, you know, we make sure that it makes the most sense you know, you don't wanna fuel yourself.
Speaker 0 (01:52:16,169-01:52:30,202): The last unit says an athlete, fuel themselves with, you know, all these sponsorships and endorsements, and it just looks tacky. Mhmm. And you you pick the right brands, ones that you know, shoot me as well. What do I believe in? You know, the the the athlete that I am.
Speaker 0 (01:52:30,302-01:52:41,007): But, you know, they deal with that. Obviously, I'm involved in it as well, and you know, make sure it's right. The deals are right. You don't get sucked into anything stupid, and, you know, you go from there.
Speaker 1 (01:52:41,386-01:52:54,329): Well, that's a that's a healthy approach, and it's it's beautiful to see a young guy like yourself with so much success but has his brain totally straightened and tied down correctly and you know, your mind is right.
Speaker 0 (01:52:54,329-01:53:04,083): And it's it's very important because, you know, this this fog dam, especially boxing, is filled with sharks Yeah. They're chameleons. Change their skin real real quick. Yeah. You know, it's it's crazy.
Speaker 0 (01:53:04,423-01:53:15,256): You know, even with with the next fight, Ben in Australia. You know, a few interviewers have asked, like, is that who pays the most money? No. Not necessarily. It's not about money.
Speaker 0 (01:53:15,356-01:53:33,783): It's about you know, what there's more promotional company for us promotion. What are they gonna be involved in? Do I get opportunities to have Guys that that with me, you know, guys had a song with me on on the cards. And I said that there because I didn't have that. I have to go through the the hard road, the local circuit.
Speaker 0 (01:53:34,083-01:54:02,985): They're literally selling my tickets, selling the tables, getting your $5 here, your $10 here, know, for each table you sold or your ticket you sold to make it. So if I can be able to change it, a talented kid that I've seen and that I have with me, put him on a car and give him the opportunities. That's more than worth more than money. And that's for me, like I like I said, it's It's about being smart, having the right right approach and, you know, changing the people around me, the good people around me, changing their lives as well.
Speaker 1 (01:54:03,065-01:54:07,982): So is that part of your goal to try to elevate the boxing scene in your in your area as well?
Speaker 0 (01:54:07,982-01:54:31,747): Definitely. That's why we have ferocious promotions, more company. We wanna keep getting the good guys, the young amateurs, the the the promising professionals, and given the right blueprint. You know, a lot of I said, a lot of people in this game, they wanna try Suck the fighter so I can draw and take everything from them. And, you know, you said all all the time, Thomas you know, time after time where voters finished the sport and left with nothing.
Speaker 0 (01:54:31,747-01:54:36,984): Yeah. I've got nothing. You know? So we put our lives on the line. We go through through Helen back.
Speaker 0 (01:54:37,083-01:54:43,040): You wanna be able to leave this sport and be able to, you know, give a good road map for these young guys coming through.
Speaker 1 (01:54:43,320-01:54:51,195): Do you have a plan for when you exit the sport? Do you think you'll stay in boxing as a trainer or as a manager or anything like that?
Speaker 0 (01:54:51,235-01:54:52,394): Definitely, I'll be involved in
Speaker 1 (01:54:52,394-01:54:52,994): boxing. Yeah.
Speaker 0 (01:54:52,994-01:54:59,470): You know, maybe the commentary. You know, I had my my debut commentary on the weekend. Yeah. But I guess you did great. Design.
Speaker 0 (01:54:59,470-01:55:06,777): I've I've got a lot of good feedback. I think the world said that we need that. We need roof orders actually doing the commentary. So that was great.
Speaker 1 (01:55:06,777-01:55:10,114): I think that's true too. I think that helps a lot. It helps with the UFC for sure.
Speaker 0 (01:55:10,114-01:55:13,232): It was it was it was fun. It was exciting for me to to be there.
Speaker 1 (01:55:13,232-01:55:19,788): Well, there's insight that a guy like you can provide Yeah. You know, a guy was a world champion that you're just not gonna get from anybody else.
Speaker 0 (01:55:19,788-01:55:37,778): Well well, me and Sean Porter were just fading off each other and back and forth, we were seeing things that we see and the aspect that we see in the foreground. So, definitely, the commentary is something I love to be involved in, you know, that that the promotional side of things, the managing side of things, and I'd love to be in the gym too, sir. I think the training side of things as well. Yeah.
Speaker 1 (01:55:37,778-01:55:39,197): Sure. I'm really gonna retire.
Speaker 0 (01:55:40,536-01:55:53,068): You you know, you can never say yes or no with a with any fighter. When he said they retired, he's been for a lot too in the fight. He's had a lot of good good wins. Yeah. You know, some some some some tough victory tough losses as well.
Speaker 0 (01:55:53,068-01:56:01,572): So, you know, maybe this time, it's it really depends how he feels. I love the same comeback. I think it was a bit premature as well. Awesome. When he said that
Speaker 1 (01:56:01,613-01:56:03,132): such a good fight until he got caught.
Speaker 0 (01:56:03,132-01:56:13,537): Yeah. Austin, that town, you know, you're doing so well against Crawford who's Yeah. Top pound for pound. You know, why throw it in now? You still got more to give, but that's that's their decision.
Speaker 1 (01:56:14,585-01:56:17,623): Did were you surprised the way his dad reacted
Speaker 0 (01:56:17,623-01:56:19,642): to I was. I really was. To.
Speaker 1 (01:56:19,822-01:56:20,981): I can't believe he said that.
Speaker 0 (01:56:20,981-01:56:26,179): Yeah. It's it just kinda put him on the spot and, like, Sean was Yeah. Just didn't know what was going on.
Speaker 1 (01:56:26,179-01:56:30,057): Like, oh, he handled it well. He just he just handled it well. You know? That that's his dad.
Speaker 0 (01:56:30,057-01:56:31,056): That's what we think now.
Speaker 1 (01:56:31,056-01:56:34,504): The people that don't know what he said is his dad said he didn't prepare And
Speaker 0 (01:56:34,504-01:56:41,281): then when you when you think about him retiring, Shredder, why you start to think, was that possibly a reason? Did he was he Well,
Speaker 1 (01:56:41,381-01:56:48,937): maybe he really didn't prepare. Correct? Maybe he's realizing that this is truth. And then nobody knows you better than your father.
Speaker 0 (01:56:48,937-01:56:49,637): That's right.
